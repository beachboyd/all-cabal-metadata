description: ! 'This tool is primarily intended for people who want to write articles

  or books using LaTeX that contain some Haskell code. It works on literate

  Haskell documents where the non-Haskell parts form essentially a valid

  LaTeX document, then processes the Haskell code in the document and

  replaces it with formatted LaTeX output. It is not fully automatic in

  the sense that it will turn an arbitrary literate Haskell document into

  a LaTeX document without further work.


  Nearly all aspects about the output and formatting are configurable.

  Output of code can be made using proportional fonts in such a way that

  even complex horizontal alignment is preserved. The preprocessor can also

  be invoked in another mode to just extract the Haskell code.'
