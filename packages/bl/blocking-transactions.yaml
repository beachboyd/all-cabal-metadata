description: ! 'A variable type (BVar), monad (BTM), and arrow

  (BTA), which provide fast, atomic, composable, blocking

  inter-thread communication.  Blocking transactions are

  strictly less expressive than software transactional

  memory, but may be more efficient under very high

  contention.'
