  QuickCheck dependency bump\n\n0.2.0.1\n-------\n\n* Dependency bump\n\n0.2.0.0\n-------\n\n*
  Properly set the version of fgl required: it needs some of the newer\n  functions
  present in 5.5.2.0 (which was not yet released when\n  version 0.1.0.0 of this library
  was released).\n\n* Allow partial application of the `SimpleGraph` type.\n\n* The
  `Connected` wrapper has changed, and the constructor is now\n  exported.\n\n0.1.0.0\n-------\n\n*
  Initial release\n"

  QuickCheck dependency for fgl whilst still making the instances

  available to others).

  graph-like data structures.'
