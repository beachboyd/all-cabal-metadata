description: ! 'See the TsParse module for details.


  There are also multiple tests in the package, but these are not built

  by default.  To get the tests, build with the "test" flag.


  Binaries you will get if you build with the "test" flag:


  * parse-tsp-pdf - given a single command-line argument which is the

  filename of a TSP PDF statement, will pretty print the data in

  the file.


  * parse-tsp-text - given a single command-line argument which is the

  filename of TSP data that is output from pdftotext (or is

  generated by gen-tsp), pretty prints the data in the file.  If no

  filename, reads standard input.


  * test-tsp - tests all QuickCheck properties in the library.


  * gen-tsp - given a single command-line argument which is the

  QuickCheck "size" parameter (this should be a non-negative

  integer), generates a valid input to the parse-tsp-text file.  The

  bigger the number, the more text you get.'
