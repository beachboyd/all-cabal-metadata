description: ! 'Interacts with tesseract to ease reading of RAW Japanese manga.


  The usage is fairly simple. Start the program, passing some temporary

  filename to use. Use the provided `scrot` button to take snippets of

  parts of your screen containing Japanese text. Once scrot has take the

  image, `tesseract` will run on it and the output will be visible in

  the UI. Mind that `tesseract` is not the fastest so there may be a

  small delay depending on size of the image.


  The radio buttons change the modes tesseract operates in. Please read

  the tesseract manpage to find out more. Vertical text is the default.
