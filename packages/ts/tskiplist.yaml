description: ! 'This package provides a proof-of-concept implementation of a skip
  list in STM. A skip list is a probabilistic data structure with dictionary operations
  and support for efficient range-queries (similarly to Data.Map). In contrast to
  tree data structures, a skip list does not need any rebalancing, which makes it
  particularly suitable for concurrent programming. (See: William Pugh. Skip Lists:
  A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees.)'
