description: A witness is a value that /witnesses/ some sort of constraint on some
  list of type variables. This library provides support for simple witnesses, that
  constrain a type variable to a single type, and equality witnesses, that constrain
  two type variables to be the same type. It also provides classes for representatives,
  which are values that represent types. See the paper /Witnesses and Open Witnesses/
  (<http://semantic.org/stuff/Open-Witnesses.pdf>).
