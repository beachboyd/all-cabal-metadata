description: ! 'A witness is a value that /witnesses/ some sort of constraint on some
  list of type variables.

  This library provides support for simple witnesses, that constrain a type variable
  to a single type, and equality witnesses, that constrain two type variables to be
  the same type.

  It also provides classes for representatives, which are values that represent types.

  See the paper /Witnesses and Open Witnesses/ (<http://semantic.org/stuff/Open-Witnesses.pdf>).'
