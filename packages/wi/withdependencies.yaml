  Model computation with dependencies, and evaluate them over streams of elements.


  This module was created to handle tree-like computations that require elements from
  a stream that might arrive in arbitrary order.


  The particular use case was a computation requiring several files from a tar archive.
  The archive would be parsed as a stream of files, and the computation would end
  as soon as all required files would be traversed.
