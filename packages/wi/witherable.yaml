changelog: |
  0.3.3
  -------

  * Added `FilterableWithIndex` and `WitherableWithIndex`.
  * Added `WrappedFoldable`

  0.3.2
  ----------

  * Added `Filterable (MonoidalMap k)` and `Witherable (MonoidalMap k)`

  0.3.1
  -------
  * Added `(<$?>)` as an alias for `mapMaybe`, with fixity matching `(<$>)`.
  * Added `(<&?>) = flip (<$?>)`, with fixity matching `(<&>)`.

  0.3
  -------
  * Added `(Filterable f, Filterable g) => Filterable (Product f g)`
  * Added `(Witherable f, Witherable g) => Witherable (Product f g)`
  * Added `(Filterable f, Filterable g) => Filterable (Sum f g)`
  * Added `(Witherable f, Witherable g) => Witherable (Sum f g)`
  * Added `Filterable f => Filterable (IdentityT f)`
  * Added `Witherable f => Witherable (IdentityT f)`
  * Switched from strict `HashMap` operations to lazy ones. This
    matches the behavior of the rest of the instances.
  * Changed the definition of `witherM`

  0.2
  -------
  * Added `Traversable t => Witherable (MaybeT t)`
  * New class: `Filterable`
    * `Witherable t` is equivalent to `(Traversable t, Filterable t)`
  * Removed `Chipped`

  0.1.3.3
  -------
  * Added `forMaybeOf` and `forMaybe`

  0.1.3.2
  -------
  * Exported `witherM`, `blightM`
  * Fixed the default definition of `catMaybes`

  0.1.3
  -------
  * Now `witherable` depends on `base-orphans` to prevent a tragedy of duplicate orphans
  * Added generalized combinators according to the `lens` convention

  0.1.2.3
  -------
  * Added `ordNub`, `hashNub`
  * Data.Witherable is now Trustworthy

  0.1.2.2
  -------
  * Added `Chipped`
