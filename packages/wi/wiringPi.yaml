synopsis: Access GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi via wiringPi library
changelog: ! "-*- Text -*-\n\n1.0.1.1  @  Thu Oct  5 11:18:47 PDT 2017\n\n* Changed
  some of the examples to work with the hs-wiringPi test board.\n\n* No changes to
  the library.\n\n1.0.1  @  Mon Mar 27 13:30:49 PDT 2017\n\n* Examples for Pi-LITEr
  and Fish Dish boards.\n\n* Added piGpioLayout as a synonym for piBoardRev, to reflect
  the name\n  change in version 2.36 of the C library.\n\n* Addition of wiringPiISR
  function.  (Contributed by Satoshi Ogata.)\n\n* Improvements to documentation and
  examples.\n\n1.0  @  Mon Jan 23 17:51:35 PST 2017\n\n* Initialization is now automatic.\n\n*
  Pin now has three constructors, one for each pin numbering scheme.\n  You can now
  mix pin numbering schemes in a single program, rather\n  than having to choose one
  at initialization time.\n\n0.1  @  Tue Jan 10 21:15:33 UTC 2017\n\n* Initial release.\n"

description: ! "[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/wiringPi.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wiringPi)\n\nThis
  is a Haskell binding to the [wiringPi library][1], which allows\nyou to interface
  with the [GPIO][4] pins on the [Raspberry Pi][2].\nUnlike some other solutions for
  using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins,\nwiringPi provides access to more advanced features,
  such as enabling\nthe internal pull-up or pull-down resistors.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo
  use this library, you must either run as root, or set the\n`WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM` environment
  variable.  (Set it to anything; the\nvalue does not matter.)  However, [PWM][7]
  will not work if\n`WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM` is set.\n\nThis library will only build on
  the Raspberry Pi.  Before building\nthis library, you must install the \"wiringPi\"
  C library on your\nRaspberry Pi, like this:\n\n    sudo apt-get install wiringpi\n\nTested
  on a Raspberry Pi Model B, with [Raspbian Jessie Lite][3],\nusing the system-provided
  Haskell compiler.  (GHC 7.6.3.)\n\n## Pin Numbering\n\nWiringPi allows each pin
  to be identified by one of three names.  A\npin can be identified by its physical
  pin number, by its Broadcom GPIO\nnumber (this is the one most commonly used in
  the Raspberry Pi\ncommunity), or by its wiringPi pin number.  The `Pin` type has
  three\nconstructors (`Wpi`, `Gpio`, and `Phys`), allowing you to call a pin\nby
  any of its three names.  These names are synonymous and\ninterchangeable.\n\nThe
  following diagram illustrates the three names of each pin, and\nalso identifies
  which pins can be placed in `PWM_OUTPUT` mode or\n[`GPIO_CLOCK`][8] mode.\n\n![Pinout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppelleti/hs-wiringPi/master/pin-diagram.png)\n\nSimilar
  diagrams are available on [the wiringPi site][5] or on\n[pinout.xyz][6].\n\nOne
  additional wrinkle is that some very early Raspberry Pis use\ndifferent Broadcom
  GPIO numbers for a few of the pins.  WiringPi\nautomatically takes this into account,
  but it means that equality for\n`Pin` actually depends on which board revision you
  have.\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis Haskell binding is licensed under the 3-clause BSD
  license, and\nthe examples in the `examples` directory are in the public domain.\nHowever,
  be aware that the wiringPi C library itself is licensed under\nthe LGPLv3+.\n\n##
  Examples\n\nThere are several examples in the `examples` directory.  You can run\neach
  example by wiring up a circuit on a breadboard as specified by\nthe comments in
  the example.  Or, for something more permanent and\nprofessional-looking, you can
  use the\n[hs-wiringPi test board](https://github.com/ppelleti/hs-wiringPi-test-board).\nThe
  hs-wiringPi test board can be used with all of the examples,\nexcept for `wpi-fishdish`,
  which requires the\n[Fish Dish](https://www.pi-supply.com/product/fish-dish-raspberry-pi-led-buzzer-board/)\nboard
  instead.\n\n[1]: http://wiringpi.com/\n[2]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/\n[3]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/\n[4]:
