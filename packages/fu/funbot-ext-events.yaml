description: ! '# funbot-ext-events


  This is a Haskell library providing types and tools for interacting with

  [FunBot][funbot]''s external events. The code was extracted from FunBot itself,

  so that independent programs can interact with it using its client API.


  Since the provided types change every time an external event type is added or

  modified, many of this library''s releases are expected to break compatibility.

  In most cases you should either use a higher-level library such as

  [funbot-client][funbot-client], or perhaps create one yourself.
