description: ! 'A few efficient list-processing functions using the prefix-function,
  which

  is defined as:


  > (prefixFun xs) !! i


  is the length of the largest proper substring of @xs@ ending at position @i@,

  such that it equals the beginning of @xs@.


  For example:


  > .-----.             .-----.

  > a b a c a b a a a b a b a c d

  > 0 0 1 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 2 3 4 0

  >                           ^


  The marked substrings are equal, hence the value at the marked location is

  their length, 4.'
