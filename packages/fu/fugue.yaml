description: ! 'Fugue intends to scratch that itchy feeling you

  get when you realize you need to import `Data.Foldable`,

  then hide `foldr` from the prelude; when you can''t decide

  whether to go all the way to the top of your buffer to

  import `Control.Monad` to get `forM` or just use

  (`flip` `mapM`) instead. Importing `Control.Applicative`

  just for (\<$\>) is annoying, but so is writing ``fmap``

  everywhere. Fugue exports a bunch of useful stuff so you

  don''t have to, tending to prefer more general functions

  from various and sundry corners of the base libraries to

  those in `Prelude`.'
