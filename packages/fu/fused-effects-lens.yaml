  [![Build Status](https://action-badges.now.sh/fused-effects/fused-effects-lens)](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects-lens/actions)

  This package provides an interface to the [`lens`](https://github.com/ekmett/lens) library (and other such libraries such as `microlens` and `generic-lens`) that is compatible with [`fused-effects`](https://github.com/robrix/fused-effects). The standard formulation of `lens` combinators for operating in `MonadState` contextsâ€”`use`, `.=`, et alâ€”rely on `mtl` for `MonadState` and `MonadReader`, which is not applicable to `Reader` and `State` effects.

  This package is meant to be used alongside `lens`, like so:

  ``` haskell
  import Control.Lens hiding (view, use, assign)
  import Control.Effect.Lens (view, use, assign)
  ```

  ## Example

  Given a `Context` type that we will use in a `State` effect:

  ``` haskell
  data Context = Context
    { _amount :: Int
    , _disabled :: Bool
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

  makeLenses ''Context
  ```

  We can can use the `use` combinators to extract a lens target from the current state, and `assign` to write to a field of that state:

  ``` haskell
  stateTest :: (Has (State Context) sig m) => m Int
  stateTest = do
    initial <- use amount
    amount .= (initial + 1)
    disabled .= True
    use amount
  ```

  You can find a more complete example, including one that works with multiple `State` constraints in a single computation, in the `test` directory.
