  Changelog
  =========

  Version 0.3.5.0
  ---------------

  *August 15, 2020*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.5.0>

  *   `DayChain` and `NightChain` renamed to `DivAp` and `DecAlt`, to better
      reflect their abstracted nature ever since *0.3.4.0*.  The modules are
      renamed to *Data.Functor.Invariant.DivAp* and
      *Data.Functor.Invariant.DecAlt*.

  *   **v0.3.5.1**: Fixed infinite recursion bug for Tensor instances of
      invariant `Day`/`Night`.

  Version 0.3.4.0
  ---------------

  *August 14, 2020*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.4.0>

  *   *Data.HFunctor.Route*: A new twist on getting invariant functor
      combinators.  Instead of creating new ones, utilize existing functor
      combinators with `Pre`/`Post`.
  *   *Data.Functor.Invariant.Day.Chain* and *Data.Functor.Invariant.Night.Chain*
      created, factoring out the `Chain` part of the invariant `Day`/`Night`.
      This was done to fix the fact that *Data.Functor.Invariant.Day* is a module
      that already existed in *kan-extensions*.  Oops!
      *   As a consequence, `DayChain` and `NightChain` are now newtype wrappers
          instead of plain type synonyms.

  *   **v0.3.4.1**: Add in missing `Functor` and `Invariant` instances for
      `ProPre` and `ProPost`, as well as a bunch of instances for `ProPre`.
  *   **v0.3.4.2**: Add in missing `HFunctor`, `Inject`, `Interpret` instances
      for `PostT`.

  Version 0.3.3.0
  ---------------

  *August 11, 2020*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.3.0>

  *   *Control.Applicative.ListF*: Missing contravariant instances added for
      `MaybeF`.
  *   *Data.HFunctor*: Add `injectMap` and `injectContramap`, two small utility
      functions that represent common patterns in injection and mapping.
  *   *Data.Functor.Combinator*: Replace `divideN` and related functions with
      `dsum` and `dsum1`, which is an altogether cleaner interface that doesn't
      require heterogenous lists.  A part of a larger project on cleaning up
      `Divisible` tools.
  *   *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Divise*: Add useful utility functions `dsum`
      and `<:>`, which makes the type of `divise` closer to that of `<|>` and
      `asum`.
  *   *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Divisible.Free*: Implement `Div` in terms of a
      list, instead of the mirrored `Ap`.  Should make it much easier to use,
      although a less-than-ideal `Coyoneda` is required to keep it compatible
      with the contravariant `Day` in *kan-extensions*.  Added patterns to
      recover the original interface.


  Version 0.3.2.0
  ---------------

  *August 9, 2020*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.2.0>

  *   *Data.HFunctor.Interpret*: `icollect`, `icollect1` now are more
      constrained: they only work on things that have `Interpret` instances for
      *all* `Monoid m` or `Semigroup m` in `AltConst m`.  While this doesn't
      affect how it works on any types in this library, it does make the type
      signature a little more clean (hiding the usage of `DList`) and prevents
      one from making an odd `Interpret` instance that does something weird with
      the `DList`.  This also allows us to drop the direct *dlist >= 1.0* dependency.
  *   *Data.HFunctor.Interpret*: `biapply`, `bifanout`, `bifanout1` added as
      contravariant consumer versions of `iget`, `icollect`, and `icollect1`.
  *   *Data.HBifunctor.Associative*: `bicollect` `bicollect1` removed because
      they really don't make sense for associative tensors, which can only have
      at most one of each tensor.
  *   *Data.HBifunctor.Associative*: `biapply` added as the contravariant
      consumer version of `biget`.
  *   *Data.Functor.Invariant.Day*: Add conversion functions from chains to the
      covariant/invariant versions, `chainAp`, `chainAp1`, `chainDiv`, and
      `chainDiv1`.
  *   *Data.Functor.Invariant.Night*: Add conversion functions from chains to the
      covariant/invariant versions, `chainDec`, `chainDec1`, `chainListF`,
      `chainNonEmptyF`.  Also add "undescored" versions to the covariant
      versions, `toCoNight_`, `chainListF_`, `chainNonEmptyF_`, to more
      accurately represent the actual contravariant either-based day convolution.
      Also changed `Share` to `Swerve`.
  *   *Data.Functor.Combinator*: `AltConst` re-exported.


  Version 0.3.1.0
  ---------------

  *August 7, 2020*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.1.0>

  *   *Data.HFunctor.Interpret*: `getI` and `collectI` made more efficient, and
      renamed to `iget` and `icollect`, respectively, to mirror `biget` and
      `bicollect`.  `getI` and `collectI` are left in with a deprecation warning.
      `icollect1` added to ensure a non-empty collection.  `AltConst` added to
      aid in implementation.
  *   *Data.HBifunctor.Associative*: `bicollect1` added to ensure a non-empty
      collection.  *biget* and *bicollect* made more efficient.
  *   *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Night*, *Data.Functor.Invariant.Night*:
      `refuted` added for a convenient `Not`.  Missing `Invariant` instance for
      `Not` also added.
  *   *Data.HFunctor.Chain*: `chainPair` and `chain1Pair` renamed to `toChain`
      and `toChain1`, respectively, to mirror `toListBy` and `toNonEmptyBy`.

  Version 0.3.0.0
  ---------------

  *August 5, 2020*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.0.0>

  *   *Data.HBifunctor.Associative*, *Data.HBifunctor.Tensor*: Support for
      `Contravariant` and `Invariant` functor combinators. Main change to the
      infrastructure: add a `FunctorBy` associated constraint to `Associative` to
      signal what "sort of functor" the tensor supports: it should either be
      `Unconstrained`, `Functor`, `Contravariant`, or `Invariant`.
  *   *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Divise*, *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Decide*,
      and *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Conclude*: Temporarily add in the
      semigroupoidal contravariant typeclasses. These should only be needed until
      they get merged into *semigroupoids*.
  *   *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Divisible*: Add free structures for
      contravariant typeclass hierarchy.
  *   Added in some new day convolutions:

      *   *Data.Functor.Contravariant.Night*: `Night`, a contravariant day
          convolution using `Either`, which is the tensor that generates
          `Conclude` (and `Decidable` kinda).
      *   *Data.Functor.Invariant.Day*: `Day`, an *invariant* day convolution
          using tuples.
      *   *Data.Functor.Invariant.Night*: `Night`, an *invariant* day convolution
          using either.

      For the invariant day convolutions, we *could* write free monoids on them
      (like `Ap`/`Div`/`Dec`).  But instead we just outsource our free structures
      to `Chain`, providing useful pattern synonyms and folding functions to
      pretend like we had an actual free structure.
  *   *Data.Functor.Combinator*: Useful functions in for working with divisible
      and decidable contravariant functors: `divideN`, `diviseN`, `concludeN`,
      `decideN`, `divideNRec`, and `diviseNRec`.
  *   `Contravariant` and `Invariant` instances for many types.
  *   *Data.HFunctor.Final*: `FreeOf` adjusted to allow for contravariant free
      types.
  *   *Data.Functor.Combinator.Unsafe*: Add `unsafeDivise` and `unsafeConclude`,
      to mirror the situation with `unsafeApply` and `unsafePlus`.

  Version 0.2.0.0
  ---------------

  *November 11, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators/releases/tag/v0.2.0.0>

  *   Major restructuring of the hbifunctor-based classes. `Data.HBifunctor.Associative`
      and `Data.HBifunctor.Tensor` are more or less completely rewritten; the
      typeclasses are restructured in order to more properly reflect the math
      that motivates them.  See the updated type classes to see what methods
      ended up where.

      However, much of the external API that is independent of the underlying
      abstraction is effectively unchanged (`biget`, etc.)

      For the most part, the migration would involve:

      *   `SF`, `MF` are now `NonEmptyBy` and `ListBy`, respectively.
      *   `-SF` and `-MF` as suffixes for function names now become `-NE` and
          `-LB`.

  *   `upgradeC` no longer exists; use unsafe functions from
      *Data.Functor.Combinator.Unsafe* instead, on a per-tensor basis.

  *   Restructuring of `Interpret`: It now takes an extra type parameter, the
      type to interpret into.  This makes it more consistent with the new `MonoidIn`
      and `SemigroupIn`.  Most of the external API should be effectively
      unchanged.

      For the most part, the migration would only affect people who *write*
      instances of `Interpret`.  Instead of

      ```haskell
      instance Interpret MyType where
          type C MyType = Monad
      ```

      you would write:

      ```haskell
      instance Monad f => Interpret MyType f where
      ```

  *[Introductory Blog Post][combinatorpedia]* / *[Hackage][hackage]*

  [combinatorpedia]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html
  [hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combinators

  Tools for working with *functor combinators*: types that take functors (or
  other indexed types) and returns a new functor that "enhances" or "mixes" them
  in some way.

  The main functionality is exported in *Data.Functor.Combinators*, but more
  fine-grained functionality and extra combinators (some of them
  re-implementations for compatibility) are available in other modules as well.

  The goal is to represent schemas, DSL's, and computations (things like parsers,
  things to execute, things to consume or produce data) by assembling
  "self-evident" basic primitives and subjecting them to many *different*
  successive transformations and combiners.  The process of doing so:

  1.  Forces you to make explicit decisions about the structure of your
      computation type as an ADT.
  2.  Allows you to retain isolation of fundamental parts of your domain as
      separate types
  3.  Lets you manipulate the structure of your final computation type through
      *normal Haskell techniques* like pattern matching.  The structure is
      available throughout the entire process, so you can replace individual
      components and values within your structure.
  4.  Allows you to fully *reflect* the structure of your final computation
      through pattern matching and folds, so you can inspect the structure and
      produce useful summaries.

  The main benefit of this library in specific is to allow you to be able to work
  with different functor combinators with a uniform and lawful interface, so the
  real functionality here is the wide variety of functor combinators from all
  around the Haskell ecosystem.  This library does not provide the functor
  combinators, as much as it re-exports them with a unified interface.  However,
  it does "fill in the matrix", in a sense, of functor combinators in specific
  roles that are missing from the haskell ecosystem.

  To jump into using it, import *Data.Functor.Combinator*.  For a full
  introduction, check out the *[Functor Combinatorpedia][combinatorpedia]*, which
  goes in-depth into the motivation behind functor combinator-driven development,
  examples of the functor combinators in this library, and details about how to
  use these abstractions!

  Comparisons
  -----------

  On the surface, *functor-combinators* look like it fills a similar space to
  effects systems and libraries like *[mtl][]*, *[polysemy][]*,
  *[freer-simple][]*, or *[fused-effects][]*.  However, the functor combinator
  design pattern actually exists on a different level.

  [mtl]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl
  [polysemy]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy
  [freer-simple]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple
  [fused-effects]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects

  Functor combinator design patterns can be used to help build the *structure* of
  the *data types* and schemas that define your program/DSL.  Once you build
  these nice structures, you then *interpret* them into some target context. This
  "target context" is the realm that libraries like *mtl* and *polysemy* can
  fill; functor combinators serve to help you define a structure for your program
  *before* you interpret it into whatever Applicative or Monad or effects system
  you end up using.
