description: ! 'FullStop splits texts into sentences, using some orthographical

  conventions (used in English and hopefully other languages).


  It recognises certain punctuation characters as sentence

  delimiters (@.?!@) and handles some abbreviations such as

  @Mr.@ and decimal numbers (eg. @4.2@).


  Note that this package is mostly a placeholder.  I hope

  the Haskell/NLP communities will run with it and upload

  a more sophisticated (family of) segmenter(s) in its

  place.  Patches (and new maintainers) would be greeted

  with delight!'
