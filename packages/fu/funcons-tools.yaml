description: ! 'The PLanCompS project (<http://plancomps.org>) has developed a component-based
  approach to formal semantics.

  The semantics of a language is defined by translating its constructs to combinations

  of `fundamental constructs'' called /funcons/.


  This package provides a collection of highly reusable funcons in "Funcons.Core",

  an interpreter for these funcons and means for defining new funcons.


  The executable provided by this package is an interpreter for running terms

  constructed from the collection of funcons provided by "Funcons.Core".

  How this executable is used is explained in "Funcons.Tools".


  Additional funcons can be defined with the helper functions provided by

  "Funcons.EDSL". The module "Funcons.Tools" provides functions for creating

  executables by extending the main interpreter with additional funcons.
