  # RtMidi

  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/riottracker/RtMidi/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/riottracker/RtMidi/tree/master)

  Haskell wrapper for [RtMidi](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/), the lightweight, cross-platform MIDI I/O library.

  ## Development

  This project is tested with Cabal (latest versions of last two compiler lines) and Stack (latest LTS).

  You can get started with development like so:

      # Build on OSX CoreMIDI support or Linux with ALSA support
      # You can also pass `--flag RtMidi:jack` for Jack support
      stack build

      # Verify that it works:
      stack exec -- rtmidi-query

  There is also a `Dockerfile` in the `docker` directory and some `make` targets that can help you verify Linux builds:

      # Build the image and tag it `haskell-rtmidi-dev`
      make docker-build

      # Enter the docker image
      make docker-repl

      # Inside the docker image:
      cabal update && cabal build

  (Note that you can't use any `RtMidi` functions in the containerized env unless you are running a Linux host, and
  even then you'd probably have to start the process with something like `docker run --device /dev/snd`.)

  ## TODO

  * Add Windows MM support. This should only require a few changes to the Cabal file.
  * See if there is a way to autodetect Jack in the Cabal file.
