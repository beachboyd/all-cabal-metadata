  Basic types for representing XML.

  The idea is to have a full set of appropriate types, which various XML
  libraries can share. Instead of having equivalent-but-incompatible types
  for every binding, parser, or client, they all share the same types can
  can thus interoperate easily.

  This library contains complete types for most parts of an XML document,
  including the prologue, node tree, and doctype. Some basic combinators
  are included for common tasks, including traversing the node tree and
  filtering children.
