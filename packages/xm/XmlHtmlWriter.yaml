description: ! "h1. An embeded language for XML and HTML\n\nXML syntax is very redundant
  and unnecessarily verbose. This is very annoying if the content of the website is
  not mostly textual.  Haskell syntax is often better in these cases. If your website
  is in fact mostly textual, this isn't for you. \n\nThis package defines a (not necessarily
  efficient) structure for type safe and syntactically beautiful xml and html.  Take
  a look at the trivial example in Main.hs."
