  _XML back and forth!_


  `xmlbf` provides `FromXML` and `ToXML` instances intended to be used as the

  familiar `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` from the `aeson` package.


  Build by running `nix-build` in the top-level directory. Alternatively, running

  `nix-shell` in the top-level directory puts you in a shell where all of the

  dependencies of this project are available. There you can use `cabal` and/or

  `./Setup.hs` as usual.
