description: ! "  xmonad-contrib : third party extensions to the xmonad window manager\n\n
  \                          http://xmonad.org\n\n    You need the ghc compiler and
  xmonad window manager installed in\n    order to use these extensions.\n\n    For
  installation and configuration instructions, please see the\n    xmonad website,
  the documents included with the xmonad source\n    distribution, and online haddock
  documentation:\n\n    http://www.xmonad.org/xmonad-docs\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelogs\n\n
  \   For a list of changes since the 0.8.x releases, see:\n\nhttp://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Notable_changes_since_0.8\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates
  to XMonadContrib-0.9 that may Require Changes to ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs\n\n    Please
  see the Changelogs and xmonad-contrib haddock documentation\n    links for further
  details regarding the following changes.\n\n    * XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops no longer
  uses layoutHook, the\n    ewmhDesktopsLayout modifier has been removed from xmonad-contrib.
  It\n    uses logHook, handleEventHook, and startupHook instead and provides\n    a
  convenient function 'ewmh' to add EWMH support to a defaultConfig.\n\n    * Most
  DynamicLog users can continue with configs unchanged, but users\n    of the quickbar
  functions 'xmobar' or 'dzen' will need to change\n    xmonad.hs: their types have
  changed to allow easier composition with\n    other XConfig modifiers. The 'dynamicLogDzen'
  and 'dynamicLogXmobar'\n    functions have been removed.\n\n    * WindowGo or safeSpawn
  users may need to change command lines due to\n    safeSpawn changes.\n\n    * People
  explicitly referencing the \"SP\" scratchpad workspace should\n    change it to
  \"NSP\" which is also used by the new Util.NamedScratchpad.\n\n    * (Optional)
  People who explicitly use swapMaster in key or mouse\n    bindings should change
  it to shiftMaster. It's the current default\n    used where swapMaster had been
  used previously. It works better than\n    swapMaster when using floating and tiled
  windows together on the\n    same workspace.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting
  or updating XMonadContrib\n\n    latest release: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad-contrib\n\n
  \   darcs version:  darcs get http://code.haskell.org/XMonadContrib\n\n    (To use
  darcs xmonad-contrib you must also use the darcs version\n    of xmonad.)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContributing\n\n
  \   Haskell code contributed to this repo should live under the\n    appropriate
  subdivision of the 'XMonad.' namespace (currently\n    includes Actions, Config,
  Hooks, Layout, Prompt, and Util). For\n    example, to use the Grid layout, one
  would import:\n\n        XMonad.Layout.Grid\n\n    For further details, see the
  documentation for the\n    XMonad.Doc.Developing module and http://xmonad.org website.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCode
  submitted to the contrib repo is licensed under the same license as\nxmonad itself,
