description: ! "# `dhall-text 1.0.9`\n\nThis `dhall-text` package provides a `dhall-to-text`
  executable which you can\nuse to template text using the Dhall configuration language.\n\nFor
  example, suppose you save the following files to your current directory:\n\n```haskell\n$
  cat Person\n-- Dhall is a typed programming language\n\n-- This file is the type
  of an anonymous record\n{ name : Text, upvotes : Integer }\n```\n\n```haskell\n$
  cat people\n-- Dhall natively supports lists and anonymous records\n\n[ { name =
  \"Maria\" , upvotes = 14 }\n, { name = \"Jordan\", upvotes =  2 }\n, { name = \"Pranav\",
  upvotes =  1 }\n]\n\n-- This file has type:\n--\n--     ./people : List { name :
  Text, upvotes : Integer }\n--\n-- ... or just:\n--\n--     ./people : List ./Person\n```\n\n```haskell\n$
  cat make-item\n    -- You can define anonymous functions in Dhall using a backslash
  (i.e. `\\`)\n    \\(person : ./Person)  -- You can import any type or expression
  by its path\n\n    -- Dhall supports multiline strings that strip leading whitespace
  and Dhall\n    -- supports string interpolation, too, using `${...}` syntax\n->
  \  ''\n    <li class=\"list-group-item\">\n      <span class=\"badge\">${Integer/show
  person.upvotes}</span>\n      ${person.name}\n    </li>\n    ''\n\n-- This file
  has type:\n--\n--     ./make-item : ./Person -> Text\n```\n\n```haskell\n$ cat make-items\n
  \   -- You can also import any type or expression by its URL\n    let List/map =
  https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmbh2ifwcpX9a384vJMehySbV7rdvYhzVbL5ySs84k8BgY/Prelude/List/map\nin
  \ let Text/concat = https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmbh2ifwcpX9a384vJMehySbV7rdvYhzVbL5ySs84k8BgY/Prelude/Text/concat\nin
  \ \\(people : List ./Person)\n->   Text/concat (List/map ./Person Text ./make-item
  people)\n\n-- This file has type:\n--\n--     ./make-items : List ./Person -> Text\n```\n\nTemplating
  HTML is just ordinary function application:\n\n```bash\n$ dhall-to-text <<< './make-items
  ./people'\n<li class=\"list-group-item\">\n  <span class=\"badge\">14</span>\n  Maria\n</li>\n\n<li
  class=\"list-group-item\">\n  <span class=\"badge\">2</span>\n  Jordan\n</li>\n\n<li
  class=\"list-group-item\">\n  <span class=\"badge\">1</span>\n  Pranav\n</li>\n\n```\n\nTo
  learn more about the Dhall configuration language,\n[read the tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall/docs/Dhall-Tutorial.html)\n\n##
  Quick start\n\nIf you have Nix then you can install this package using:\n\n```bash\n$
  nix-env --install --attr dhall-text --file release.nix\n```\n\n## Development status\n\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/Haskell-Dhall-JSON-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/Haskell-Dhall-JSON-Library)\n\nI
  don't expect this library to change unless:\n\n* ... the Dhall language changes,
  which is possible but not very likely\n* ... there are bugs, which is unlikely given
  how simple the implementation is\n\n## License (BSD 3-clause)\n\n    Copyright (c)
