synopsis: Compile Dhall to JSON or YAML
changelog: |
  1.2.8

  * New `json-to-dhall` command-line utility
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/884
  * `--omitEmpty` now also omits empty arrays
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/872
  * Build against `dhall-1.22.0`
  * Improved error messages:
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/895
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/900

  1.2.7

  * Build against `dhall-1.21.0`
  * Support GHC 7.10.3
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/814
  * Add new `--omitEmpty` flag for omitting nulls and empty records

  1.2.6

  * Add `--version` flag
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/704
  * Build against `tasty-1.2`
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/731
  * Add `--compact` flag to `dhall-to-json`
      * Eventually `--pretty` will become the default, so this flag provides a
        way for a user to preserve the old 1-line output when that happens
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/743

  1.2.5

  * Build against `dhall-1.19.0`
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/667

  1.2.4

  * Build against `dhall-1.18.0`
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-json/pull/61
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-json/pull/63
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-json/pull/67
  * New `dhall-to-yaml` `--documents` flag for generating split documents
      * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-json/pull/59
  * Build against `yaml-0.10.2.0`
