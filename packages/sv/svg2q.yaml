description: svg2q will generate an Objective C Class from an SVG file which shows
  the SVG. The Class offers methods to set attributes of those SVG elements that have
  ids to change looks at runtime. This package is the result of a bachelors thesis
  and is not yet ready to use for "normal" SVGs. Upon request, usability may be improved
  if spare time is available.
