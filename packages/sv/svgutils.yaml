description: ! 'A library for performing simple manipulations with SVG

  files, primarily tiling several SVG files together into a

  single file (ready for printing).


  As well as the exposed library modules, the package comes

  with an executable called SVGtile that can perform this

  SVG tiling from the command-line.  SVGtile takes a list

  of SVG files as command-line arguments, then generates

  lots of files of the form TiledFront-1.svg.  Paper-size

  (default A4) and other settings can be set using

  command-line options: see SVGtile --help.'
