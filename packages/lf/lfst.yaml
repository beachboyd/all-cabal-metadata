description: If X is a collection of objects denoted generically by x, then a fuzzy
  set F(A) in X is a set of ordered pairs. Each of them consists of an element x and
  a membership function which maps x to the membership space M. The current implementation
  is inspired by the work of Goguen, Joseph A. "L-fuzzy sets." Journal of mathematical
  analysis and applications 18.1 (1967).
