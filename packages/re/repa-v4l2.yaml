description: ! "Provides high-level access to webcams for Haskell programs.\n\nThe
  current state is that the library provides a monad for\ngrabbing images from a webcam
  under Linux. In the future, more functionality like \nimage processing functions
  and other input devices may be added.\n\nLast time I checked, the v4l2 package was
  not on hackage, \nbut it can be retrieved from here:\n https://gitorious.org/hsv4l2\n\nFor
  images, repa arrays are used. Therefore, all the repa goodness\ncan be used with
  the data. It should also be possible without too much hassle \nto write a function
  which gets the data into a different type of array,\nif that is necessary.\n\nGetting
  an image with a v4l webcam works like this:\n\n> import Graphics.Webcam.Linux\n>
  main = runCam (grab >>= saveBmp \"my_image.bmp\") (Webcam 0)\n\nIf anyone wants
  to help, please contact me!\n"
