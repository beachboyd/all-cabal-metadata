description: ! 'This library is deprecated in favour of the hedis package,

  but minor patches to keep it building etc will be applied.



  Redis (<http://redis.io>) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced

  key-value store. It is often referred as a data structure server

  since keys can contain different data structures, such as strings,

  hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.


  This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. It''s tested with

  current git version and with v2.4.6 of redis server. It also

  tested with v2.2 and basic functions are works correctly

  but not all of them.


  You can use Test module from the source package to run unit

  tests. Try /runhaskell Test.hs --help/ for usage info. Caution! Do not

  run tests on your working database - test database will be

  flushed.


  There are simple benchmark module included: Benchmark.hs. It shows

  me about two times less requests per second than redis-benchmark

  from server distribution.


  Please let me know if tests or benchmark goes terribly wrong.


  Changes from v0.12:
