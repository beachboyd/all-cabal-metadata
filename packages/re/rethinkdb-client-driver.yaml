description: ! 'This is an alternative client driver for RethinkDB. It is not complete

  yet, but the basic structure is in place and the driver can make

  simple queries.


  Its main focus is on type safety, which it achieves quite well. It also

  uses the new JSON protocol which should give it a speed boost (and make

  the driver compatible with GHC 7.8).


  Note that the driver is neither thread-safe nor reentrant. If you have

  a multi-threaded application, I recommend using ''resource-pool''.'
