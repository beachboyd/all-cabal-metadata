description: ! '`reflex-jsx` is a library for writing jsx-like syntax in

  reflex code. This can be useful for situations where you

  have a large block of HTML with some styles, and it would

  be easier to read as actual HTML than various reflex

  functions.

  It''s implemented as a "QuasiQuoter", so you just import the

  `jsx` function from ReflexJsx and generate the equivalent

  functions that would run inside of a "MonadWidget t m".

  Not only can you generate a block of static HTML/CSS, but you

  can also splice in your own nodes that implement

  "MonadWidget t m", string attribute values, or even entire

  dynamic attribute maps.'
