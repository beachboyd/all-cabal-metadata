synopsis: home (etc) automation using reactive-banana
changelog: |
  reactive-banana-automation (0.5.2) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Support stm-2.5.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 25 Aug 2019 14:11:26 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.5.1) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added Eq and Ord instances for PowerChange.
    * Added automationChanges and actuateFutureEvent.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 22 Aug 2018 18:26:15 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.5.0) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Remove onEvent, which allowed arbitrary IO not connected with
      actuators, and so was not good for testing. (API change)
    * Add actuateEvent.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 22 May 2018 17:25:45 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.4.0) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Simplified using ReaderT, so sensors and actuators do not need to be
      manually passed around. (API change)
    * Add Ord and Eq instances for Sensed.
    * Renamed onBehaviorChange to actuateBehavior.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 09 May 2018 12:12:08 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.3.0) upstream; urgency=medium

    * EventSource is now a data type with an extra value for expansion.
      (API change)
    * Added newEventSource, sensorUnavailable, sensedEventBehavior,
      and automationStepper.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 05 May 2018 19:27:56 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.2.0) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Automation is now a newtype. (API change)
    * Monoid instance for Automation to allow easily combining them.
      (Note that in 0.1, there were inherited Monoid and Monad instances
      for Automation, that did not work in a reasonable way.)

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 03 May 2018 18:54:04 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.1.2) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added ClockSignal and related functions.
    * Functor instances for Sensed and Timestamped.
    * Added more Timestamp instances.
    * Generalized sensedAt to work with any Timestamp.
    * Added several more examples, including a night light,
      a behavior for a tipping bucket rain gauge, and sprinkers
      that only run when it's not rained recently.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 03 May 2018 17:28:32 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.1.1) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Fix build with ghc 8.2 and reactive-banana 1.2.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 21 Apr 2018 20:14:41 -0400

  reactive-banana-automation (0.1) upstream; urgency=low

    * First release.

description: |-
  Functional Reactive Programming is a natural fit for home automation,
  which involves sensor values that vary over time and are used to control
  actuators.

  This library provides a framework and some useful types for
  using the reactive-banana FRP library for home automation.
