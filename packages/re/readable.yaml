synopsis: Reading from Text and ByteString
changelog: ! "0.4\n---\n* Reinstate Text and ByteString instances because some users
  require them.\n\n0.3.0.1\n-------\n* Add yes/no and y/n parsing to the Bool instance\n\n0.3\n---\n*
  Remove Readable instances for ByteString and Text because they are probably\n  not
  what the user wants and could cause compilation to succeed when you\n  probably
  want to see an error.\n\n0.2.0.2\n-------\n* Fix fromBS for ByteString so it is
  a correct passthrough instead of doing\n  encodeUtf8 . decodeUtf8 under the hood.\n\n0.2.0.1\n-------\n*
  Use decodeUtf8' so that we can catch character encoding exceptions and\n  return
  mzero instead of generating an exception.\n"

  ========


  The Read type class is very useful for building data types from String

  representations.  But String has high overhead, so sometimes it isn''t suitable

  for applications where space usage and performance are important.  This

  library provides a simpler version of Read''s functionality for Text and UTF8

  encoded ByteStrings.
