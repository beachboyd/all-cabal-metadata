description: ! "#+TITLE: README for Referees v0.0.0\n#+AUTHOR: Pablo Couto\n#+EMAIL:
  pablo@infty.in\n\n* Overview\n\n/Referees/ is a tool for computing distributions,
  among reviewers, of material to review.\n\nIt takes into consideration the areas
  of expertise of the referees, the number of items that they accept for review, the
  languages they understand, and the minimum and maximum number of copies we may want
  to distribute per each item to review.\n\n/Referees/ is distributed according to
  the terms and conditions of the [[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html][GNU GPL
  v3]] license.\n\n* Example of use\n\nThe program reads two CSV files, one for referees
  and the other for proposals. Each line in these files must have the following format:\n\n:
  Name,Capacity,Language;…;Language,Area,Subarea;…;Subarea\n\nThe =Area= field can
  be empty but must be present; =Subarea= is also optional.\nNote that different =Subarea=
  (and =Language=) values are separated by =;= within only one field.\n\n=Capacity=
  and =Language= fields are optional. If only one\nof them is included, the program
  will detect which one on the basis of whether\nit contains digits.\n\nIf there are
  many areas (and corresponding subareas) for some =Name=, these go\nin different
  lines, as in the following example:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC\nRefereeA,3,Spanish,Metaphysics,Identity\nRefereeA,Greek,Aesthetics\nRefereeB,1,PoliticalPhilosophy,State;Justice\nRefereeC,Catalan,PhilosophyOfMind,Perception\n#+END_SRC\n\nLet’s
  say we have, then, two files in that format: =referees.csv= and =proposals.csv=.
  These are the options we have at the command line, as would be shown by passing
  the =-?= flag:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC\n  referees [OPTIONS] <referees> <proposals>\n\n            --ca=<integer>
  \   Default capacity for referees with none\n                              assigned.
  [default: 1]\n            --maxc=<integer>  Number of minimum copies per proposal
  to\n                              distribute. If this value is higher than --maxc,\n
  \                             or no --maxc is given, it will also be set as the\n
  \                             maximum number of copies to distribute.\n                              [default:
  0]\n            --minc=<integer>  Number of maximum copies per proposal to\n                              distribute.
  [default: 1]\n  -l=<text>                   Default language for referees with none\n
  \                             assigned. Providing a default language is\n                              optional.\n
  \ -?        --help            Display help message\n#+END_SRC\n\nSo, for distributing
  a minimum of 2 copies and a maximum of 3 per each proposal among the referees, each
  of them accepting at most 1 proposal, while setting English as /lingua franca/,
  we would write:\n\n: $ referees \"referees.csv\" \"proposals.csv\" --minc=2 --maxc=3
  --ca=1 -l=English\n\nThis will print a distribution, if any is found – or an informative
  message if that wasn’t possible.\n\n* Installation\n\nTo install Referees, simply
  use Cabal:\n\n: $ cabal install Referees\n\nYou may need to acquire Cabal first
  with your package manager of choice.\n\nThis program relies on [[https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/][GNU
  GLPK]], so please make sure you also have it installed.\n"
