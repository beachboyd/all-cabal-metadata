description: ! 'From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling>: "Reservoir
  sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of
  k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown
  number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesn''t fit into main memory."

  This package implements Jeffrey Vitter''s Algorithm R <http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/vitter.pdf>,
  suitable for unweighted sampling from a collection of unknown size.'
