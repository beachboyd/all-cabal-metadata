changelog: ! "# Changelog\n\n## 0.39\n\n* Add support for versionless APIs, thanks
  to Tenor Biel. This is a\n  breaking change. Old API users will have to add `Versioned`
  before\n  their list of api versions, so it becomes `Versioned [ (mkVersion\n  ...)
  ]`.\n\n## 0.38\n\n* Add `RawJsonO`, `RawJsonI`, `RawJsonAndXmlI`, and `RawJsonAndXmlO`.\n*
  Remove Show constraint from ReadId\n\n## 0.37\n\n* Allow specifying custom multi-action.
  Previously there was always a\n  top-level POST that could perform multiple actions
  in the API at\n  once. Now you can customize this handler (e.g. to add logging or\n
  \ optimisations) , or turn it off completely by returning `NotFound`.\n\n  Because
  this is an experimental feature, it's exposed through\n  `Rest.Driver.Routing.Internal`
  and is subject to future breaking\n  changes without a major bump.\n\n  There is
  one breaking change due to this: the signature of `route`\n  now requires a `Monad`
  and `Applicative` constraint on `m`. This\n  propagates to `Rest.Run.apiToHandler(')`
  and related functions in\n  the rest-happstack, rest-snap and rest-wai packages.\n\n####
  0.36.0.6\n\n* Security: don't allow newlines in filenames.\n\n#### 0.36.0.5\n\n*
  Fix documentation for `fileO`.\n* Allow `HUnit 1.3.*`.\n\n#### 0.36.0.4\n\n* Drop
  (internal) dependency on either, this removes 20(!) transitive\n  dependecies.\n\n####
  0.36.0.3\n\n* Allow `either 4.4.*`\n\n#### 0.36.0.2\n\n* Allow `aeson 0.9.*`\n\n####
  0.36.0.1\n\n* Allow `errors 2.0.*`\n\n## 0.36\n\n* File output now needs a third
  component, specifying if the file is\n  served as 'attachment' or not. If so, this
  will make most browsers\n  download the file instead of displaying it. This is a
  breaking\n  change. You can add a third element `False` to the return value to\n
  \ get the old behaviour.\n\n* Re-exported XML serializable types from `rest-types`
  no longer have\n  `regular` `PF` instances since they are now using GHC Generics.\n\n####
  0.35.1\n\n* Remove unneeded constraint from `domainReason`.\n\n## 0.35\n\n* Change
  input/output dictionaries to indicate separately if there are\n  dictionaries, and
  for what type. This is a breaking change. The most\n  likely problems are where
  `Reason ()` is explicitly used in handlers\n  without error dictionaries. Simply
  replace these with `Reason_`.\n  Additionally, all `some*` combinators are deprecated
  now. They are\n  just the identity function and can be removed.\n\n* The types of
  all dictionary combinators have changed, the Dicts\n  type, the dicts smart constructor,
  empty, SomeError, Modifier, many\n  internal (but exported) things in Rest.Driver.Perform,
  some types in\n  Rest.Handler, and Void was moved.\n\n* Switched all usages of `ErrorT`
  to `ExceptT`. To stay backwards\n  compatible with older versions of `transformers`
  and `mtl` you can\n  use the `transformers-compat` and `mtl-compat` packages. To
  update\n  your code: `s/ErrorT/ExceptT` and\n  `s/Control.Monad.Error/Control.Monad.Except/`.\n\n*
  Add `>|<` to `Rest.Error`. It combines two `ExceptT` computations\n  yielding the
  last error if both fail. This is a replacement for\n  using `<|>` with `ErrorT`
  since the `Alternative ExceptT` instance\n  needs a `Monoid` instance for the error.\n\n*
  Fix typos in haddock for `Param` dictionary.\n\n* Switch to explicit export lists
  where missing.\n\n#### 0.34.0.3\n\n* Allow `aeson-utils 0.3.*`\n\n#### 0.34.0.2\n\n*
  Allow utf8-string 1.\n\n#### 0.34.0.1\n\n* Fix for base 4.8/GHC 7.10.\n\n## 0.34\n\n*
  Allow setting the method in the requests in a top level multi\n  handler.\n* The
  `getMethod` `Rest` class function now returns a `Maybe`.\n* The `route` method in
  `Rest.Driver.Routing` now takes a `Maybe\n  Method`.\n* The `Method` type was removed
  from `Rest.Driver.Types` and moved to\n  rest-types' `Rest.Types.Method`.\n\n####
  0.33.2\n\n* Allow top level multi handler as a POST as well as a GET.\n  Technically,
  you're not allowed to vary the response based on the\n  body of a GET. Also, in
  some frameworks (e.g. jQuery) it isn't\n  possible to set the body of a GET.\n\n####
  0.33.1.2\n\n* Typo fixes in documentation.\n\n#### 0.33.1.1\n\n* Declare correct
  error return type for derived multi handlers. These\n  were declared as `Reason
  (Reason e)`, now they are `Reason ()`. This\n  generated confusing documentation.\n\n###
  0.33.1\n\n* Move `Range` from `Rest.Handler` into `rest-types`. Still re-exported.\n\n##
  0.33\n\n* Added a `Rest.Types.Error.ToResponseCode` constraint to `jsonE`, `xmlE`,
  and `xmlJsonE`.\n* Changed `domainReason` to have a `ToResponseCode` constraint
  instead of an explicit argument.\n* Added `Rest.ShowUrl` re-exporting `ShowUrl`
  from `rest-types`.\n* `application/*` and `application/octet-stream` accept headers
  now match file outputs.\n\n#### 0.32.0.2\n* Allow random 1.1.*\n\n#### 0.32.0.1\n*
  Fix bug in Chrome when serving files with commas in name.\n\n## 0.32\n\n* Add `addHeader`
  dictionary combinator, to extend instead of replace\n  the header dictionaries.
  For this, a constructor `TwoHeaders` was\n  added to `Header`.\n* Relax the types
  of `mkListing` and `mkOrderedListing` to allow\n  parameters and headers.\n\n###
  0.31.1\n\n* Expose `Rest.Driver.Routing.splitUriString`.\n* Make test cases compile
  again.\n\n## 0.31\n\n* Schema: `action` has been renamed to `static` since it is
  tied to `statics` and to disambiguate it from the unrelated `actions`.\n\n#### 0.30.0.3\n\n*
  Use `json-schema 0.5.*`\n\n#### 0.30.0.2\n\n* Use `rest-stringmap == 0.2.*`\n\n####
  0.30.0.1\n\n* Allow `mtl == 2.2.*` and `transformers == 0.4.*`\n\n## 0.30\n\n* Use
  `Content-Disposition` to provide filenames for file responses.\n  This slightly
  changes the semantics of `FileO`: what used to be\n  interpreted as the file extension
  is now used for the whole file name.\n\n* `Rest.Types.Container.StringMap` Has been
  replaced by `rest-stringmap`. This\n  changes the XML serialization format of multi
  part messages, the old format\n  was `<map><key>k</key>v[...]</map>` and the new
  one is\n  `<map><value key=\"k\">v</value>[...]</map>`.\n\n## 0.29\n\n* Add multi-delete
  handler. It is used on a DELETE to\n  `/<resource>/<id>/` and is derived from the
  single delete handler.\n* Don't put `Cache-Control: private` header on served files.
  This way\n  they can be cached by public proxies, e.g. cloudfront.\n* Add `Show`
  instances for `Header`, `Param` and `Dict`.\n* Renamed `mkMultiPutHandler` to `mkMultiHandler`
  in\n  `Rest.Driver.Routing`.\n* Explicit exports in `Rest.Driver.Routing`, removing
  a lot of\n  private functions from the public interface.\n"
