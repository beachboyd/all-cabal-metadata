description: ! "#+TITLE: remark â€” a DSL for marking student work\n\n#+ATTR_HTML: title=\"License:
  BSD 3-Clause\"\n[[LICENSE][file:https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg]]\n#+ATTR_HTML:
  title=\"Travis CI Status\"\n[[https://travis-ci.org/oleks/remark][file:https://travis-ci.org/oleks/remark.svg]]\n\nWhen
  judging student performance, it is useful to have both small, composable,\nquantitive
  judgements, and qualitative remarks. This makes both spreadsheets\nand mere text-files
  ill-suited for marking student work.  Although\n[[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]
  can solve this problem to a great extent, it\nbecomes a heavy tool in the light
  of having to mark hundreds of students in a\ndistributed fashion. With org-mode,
  everything is in one file, while global,\nintra-student statistics are not needed
  until all the students have been fully\nmarked.\n\n* Design Goals\n\n  1. One human-readable/editable
  file per student.\n  2. Export options to spreadsheet-formats.\n  3. git-friendly
  file format.\n  4. Synchronization options with Dropbox and/or Google Drive.\n\nGoal
  4 is not necessarily related to remark, but is related to marking student\nwork
  with external examiners, who are not always willing to use more explicit\nversion-control
  systems, such as git.\n\n* Files and Directories\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC\noleks-1.mrk\noleks-2.mrk\noleks-3.mrk\noleks/4.mrk\noleks/5.mrk\noleks/6.mrk\n#+END_SRC\n\n*
  Syntax\n\nA =.mrk= file is a list of judgements. A judgement is a header, with a
  title,\nset points, and maximum points, followed by some comments.\n"
