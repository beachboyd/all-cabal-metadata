synopsis: Reifies arbitrary terms into types that can be reflected back into terms
changelog: ! "# 2.1.3 [2018.01.18]\n* Add `Semigroup` instance for `ReflectedMonoid`.\n\n#
  2.1.2\n* Support cross-compilation and unregistered GHC builds.\n\n# 2.1.1.1\n*
  Fixed typos in the documentation.\n\n# 2.1.1\n* Fixed support for GHC 7.0\n\n# 2.1\n*
  Added `ReifiedMonoid` and `ReifiedApplicative`.\n\n# 2\n* Added `reifyNat` and `reifySymbol`
  for GHC 7.8+, capable of reflecting into the `KnownNat` and `KnownSymbol` classes
  respectively for use with other APIs.\n* Back-ported `reifyTypeable` from `lens`.
  This enables us to perform a (less efficient) form of `Typeable` reflection.\n\n#
  1.5.2\n* Renamed the flag for disabling the use of `template-haskell`, to `-f-template-haskell`
  for consistency with my other packages.\n\n# 1.5.1.2\n* Builds warning-free on GHC
  7.10.\n* Added a dynamic FromJSON example.\n\n# 1.5.1.1\n* Updated the link to the
  paper.\n* More examples.\n\n# 1.5.1\n* We no longer export Show (Q a) for GHC >=
  7.4. This was causing random hangs when users tried to somehow run declaration splices
  from the REPL.\n* We no longer depend on tagged for GHC >= 7.8, since `Proxy` is
  now in `base`.\n\n# 1.5\n* Added a flag to disable `template-haskell` support for
  GHC stage1 platforms.\n* Added instances of `Reifies` for `GHC.TypeLits`\n\n# 1.4\n*
  Changed the behavior of the $(1) template haskell splices for Exp to use a Proxy
  rather than value-level numbers. This is more consistent with the role of this libraary
  and the other could always be generated via sa splice anyways.\n\n# 1.3.1\n* Added
  a workaround for changes in the behavior of the internal 'Magic' datatype under
  the current GHC PolyKinds implementation.\n\n# 1.3\n* Merged some functionality
  from Data.Analytics.Reflection. Notably the ability to use type nats to reflect
  numbers, and to splice numbers directly. This reduces orphan instances somewhat.\n\n#
  1.2\n* Added `Given` and give.\n\n# 1.1.7\n* Fixed an issue caused by changes in
  GHC 7.7's typechecker by using explicit `ScopedTypeVariables`.\n\n# 1.1.6:\n* Relaxed
  an unnecessary strictness annotation in the fast implementation\n\n# 1.1.5\n* Both
  implementations now work on Hugs; the fast implementation ascends\n  from the ranks
  of completely unportable black magic to being merely\n  /mostly/ unportable black
  magic.\n\n# From 0.5 to 1.1:\n\n* Much faster implementation available that is about
  50 /times/ faster than\n  0.9 and which runs purely on black magic. This version
  is now used by\n  default. To turn it off install with the `slow` flag. If you encounter
  a\n  problem with the implementation, please contact the author.\n* Removed `ReifiedNum`,
  `reflectNum`, and `reifyIntegral`; `reify` and\n  `reflect` are about 3 orders of
  magnitude faster than the special case\n  combinators were.\n\n# 0.5\n* Generalized
  the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type\n  with kind `* ->
  *` wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type\n  argument rather than just
  a `Proxy`.\n\n# 0.4\n* Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection.
  This\n  reduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user\n
  \ code.\n"

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/reflection.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflection)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection)


  This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in [Functional Pearl:
  Implicit Configurations](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/tr-15-04.pdf) by Oleg Kiselyov
  and Chung-Chieh Shan. However, the API has been implemented in a much more efficient
  manner.
