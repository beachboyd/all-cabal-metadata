description: ! 'Provides code for binary parsing of ESRI shapefiles,

  where the .shp and the .dbf file are read. The code has

  not been tested on a large variety of shapefiles so

  your mileage may vary, but so far it has worked with

  no problems. At the moment only text and number fields

  in DBF files are read (the others are stored as

  ByteString).'
