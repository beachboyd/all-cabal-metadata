description: ! 'In the Unix shell there is no easy way to use a filter program

  to change the contents of a file in-place. For example, if you

  want to sort a file in place, this will not work:


  sort \< myfile \> myfile


  All that will get you is an empty myfile. This package

  gives you the rewrite program, so this will work:


  rewrite myfile sort'
