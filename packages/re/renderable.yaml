description: ! 'The `renderable` package provides a method for managing resources

  of a rendering system. Resources are allocated according to a strategy and

  released automatically when your renderable data changes. These changes are

  detected during each draw call based on the hash of your renderable

  datatype.

  This package is meant to be pulled in as a portion of your rendering system.

  It aims to ease the task of managing allocation of resources over time as

  the value of your renderable datatype changes.'
