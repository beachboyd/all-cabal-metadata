description: ! 'Monadic HTTP request handlers combinators to build a standalone web
  apps. Most of them deal with request data.

  Some of them allow mapping part of the URL to public folders in the file system.
  There is also a combinator for

  sending files efficiently in the response (a fork of the HTTP library was necessary
  for this, included here).'
