description: ! "reflex-animation [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Saulzar/reflex-animation.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Saulzar/reflex-animation)\n====================\n\n\nThis
  package provides a set of functions for creating and playing continuous animations
  of the form Time -> a.\nFinite animations (with a length) and infinite animations
  complement one another, we chose a representation of \nfinite animations which has
  only a length (and not a starting point) to keep things simple. If needed such animations\ncan
  be converted to infinite animations, combined, and clipped as required"
