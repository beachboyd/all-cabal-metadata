description: |-
  A library that provides extensible records and variants,
  both indexed by a type-level red-black tree that maps
  Symbol keys to value Types.

  The keys correspond to fields
  names in records, and to branch names in variants.

  Each value type in a field or branch comes wrapped in a
  type constructor of kind @Type -> Type@.

  The records and variants can be converted to and from
  regular Haskell datatypes; also to and from the unlabelled
  n-ary products and sums of the @sop-core@ package.
