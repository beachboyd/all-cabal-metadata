  # `resourcet-pool`

  `resource-pool` provides the `Pool` abstraction, which performs resource allocation. Independently, `resourcet` provides the `Acquire` abstraction, which also performs resource allocation, but also plugs into the `MonadResource` type class. This library provides a way of converting a `Pool` into an `Acquire`, if using `Acquire` functions is easier for your application.

  This library exports a single function

  ```hs
  poolToAcquire :: Pool a -> Acquire a
  ```

  which pretty much does what it says on the box.
