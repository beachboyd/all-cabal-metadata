description: ! 'This library exports `FromXml` and `ToXml` instances (from the `xmlbf`

  library) for many of the types exported by the `safe-money` library.


  Note: The code in this library used to be part of the `safe-money`

  library itself, so these instances are intended to be backwards

  compatible with older versions of `safe-money`.
