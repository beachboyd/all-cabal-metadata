description: ! 'Protocol suite for the Salvia webserver, including functionality for
  URI,

  HTTP, Cookie and MIME.

  This pacakage exposes the datatypes, parsers, pretty printers and some

  utility functions to deal with several web protocols. The /fclabels/ package

  is used to generate labels pointing into the exposed datatypes, allowing to

  easily get, set and modify parts of the structures.'
