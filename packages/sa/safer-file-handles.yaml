description: ! "This package adds three safety features on top of the regular\n[System.IO]
  file handles and operations:\n\n* Regional file handles. Files must be opened in
  a *region*. When the\n  region terminates all opened files are automatically closed.
  The\n  main advantage of regions is that the handles to the opened files\n  can
  not be returned from the region which ensures no I/O with closed\n  files is possible.\n\n*
  Explicit IOModes. The regional file handles are parameterized by the\n  IOMode in
  which they were opened. All operations on handles\n  explicitly specify the needed
  IOMode. This way it is impossible to\n  read from a write-only handle or write to
  a read-only handle for\n  example.\n\n* Type-safe filepath creation and manipulation
  using the [pathtype]\n  package.\n\nThe primary technique used in this package is
  called \"Lightweight\nmonadic regions\" which was [invented][1] by Oleg Kiselyov
  and\nChung-chieh Shan.\n\nThis technique is implemented in the [regions] package
  which is\nre-exported from `safer-file-handles`.\n\nSee the [safer-file-handles-examples]
  package for examples how\nto use this package:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/basvandijk/safer-file-handles-examples.git\n\nSee
  the [safer-file-handles-bytestring] and [safer-file-handles-text]\npackages for
  `ByteString` / `Text` operations on regional file\nhandles.\n\n[System.IO]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/System-IO.html\n\n[1]:
