description: ! 'This library exports `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances (from the

  `aeson` library) for many of the types exported by the `safe-money`

  library.


  Note: The code in this library used to be part of the `safe-money`

  library itself, so these instances are intended to be backwards

  compatible with older versions of `safe-money`.
