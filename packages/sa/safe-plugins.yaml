description: ! 'This library allows you to load plugins, just as hs-plugins do.

  But under some circumstances, you do not want to allow

  plugins to do everything they want. What about plugin

  which executes `rm -rf /*'' ? In Haskell, you can limit

  plugin''s abilities just by not allowing it to import `not

  safe'' modules (System.IO.Unsafe, etc). With this library,

  you specify a list of modules that plugin should be forced

  to import (i.e., some plugin API module), and a list of

  module that you want to allow plugin to import (some

  `surely safe'' modules). Plugin cannot import any other

  modules. Moreover, you can specify some language

  extensions, for example, NoImplicitPrelude.'
