description: ! 'Salvia is a feature rich modular web server and web application framework

  that can be used to write dynamic websites in Haskell. From the lower level

  protocol code up to the high level application code, everything is written as

  a Salvia handler. This approach makes the server extremely extensible. To see

  a demo of a Salvia website, please see the /salvia-demo/ package.


  All the low level protocol code can be found in the /salvia-protocol/

  package, which exposes the datatypes, parsers and pretty-printers for the

  URI, HTTP, Cookie and MIME protocols.


  This Salvia package itself can be separated into three different parts: the

  interface, the handlers and the implementation. The /interface/ module

  defines a number of type classes that the user can build the web application

  against. Reading the request object, writing to the response, or gaining

  direct access to the socket, all of these actions are reflected using one

  type class aspect in the interface. The /handlers/ are self contained modules

  that implement a single aspect of the Salvia web server. The handlers expose

  their interface requirements in their type context. Salvia can have multiple

  /implementations/ which can be switched by using different instances for the

  interface type classes. This package has only one implementation, a simple

  accepting socket loop server. The /salvia-extras/ package has two additional

  implementations. Keeping a clear distinction between the abstract server

  aspects and the actual implementation makes it very easy to migrate existing

  web application to different back-ends.'
