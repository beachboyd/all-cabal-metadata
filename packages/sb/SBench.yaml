description: ! 'The package provides a framework for heap and runtime measurements

  for single Haskell functions. For heap measurements simple programs

  are created, compiled with profiling options and run. You can do

  either a heap profile or a graph for the maximal heap consumption

  of a function over different inputsizes. For runtime measurements

  the criterion library is used.

  Measurement data can be stored in a special file format providing

  besides the data some meta information about the measurement.

  Furthermore measured data can be plotted easily using gnuplot.

  In particular, it is possible to compare measurements for different

  functions (e.g. different version of a semantically equivalent

  function) in one diagram. By using gnuplot for drawing, the

  appearance of a diagram is very flexible and can be adjusted

  directly to, for example, the style of your paper.'
