synopsis: Haskell binding to the ODBC API, aimed at SQL Server driver
changelog: ! "0.2.1:\n\t* Expose rawUnescapedText\n\n0.2.0:\n\t* Drop Maybes, use
  NullValue.\n\n0.1.1:\n\t* Fix Smalldatetime ToSql instance to set seconds to 0.\n\t*
  Add support for numeric.\n\n0.1.0:\n\t* Removed instance of ToSql for LocalTime,
  added two new\n\tnewtypes: Datetime2 and Smalldatetime.\n\n0.0.4:\n\t* Improved
  non-Unicode field support: varchar/text treated as\n\tactual binary, not \"characters\"
  in the SQL server sense.\n\n0.0.3:\n\t* Handle multiple statements in exec call.\n"

  [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vpn6a1pme25upbux?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chrisdone/odbc-0os0b)\n\nHaskell
  binding to the ODBC API, with a strong emphasis on stability,\ntesting and simplicity.\n\n##
  Platform and database support\n\nThe following database drivers are tested against
  in CI:\n\n* Microsoft SQL Server 2017\n\nThe following operating systems are tested
  against in CI:\n\n* Windows [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vpn6a1pme25upbux?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chrisdone/odbc-0os0b)\n*
  Linux [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/odbc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/odbc)\n\nI
  develop and test this library on OS X, but currently do not have a\nreliable way
  to run Microsoft SQL Server on Travis CI.\n\n## How ODBC works\n\nODBC is a C API
  that is split into a *manager* and a *driver*.\n\nOn Windows, there is an ODBC manager
  that comes with the OS. On Linux\nand OS X, the unixODBC package provides the same
  functionality.\n\nSeparately, for each database type, you have driver packages.
  When you\nprovide a connection string, like this:\n\n```\nODBC_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING='DRIVER={ODBC
  Driver 13 for SQL Server};SERVER=127.0.0.1;Uid=SA;Pwd=Passw0rd;Encrypt=no'\n```\n\nThe
  `DRIVER` tells the ODBC API which library to use. In this case,\nit's the recent
  SQL Server driver provided by Microsoft. Then, ODBC\nfunctions like `SQLDriverConnectW`
  will call that library.\n\n## How to connect to Microsoft SQL Server\n\nIn recent
  years, Microsoft has released binary drivers for SQL Server\nfor Windows, Linux
  and OS X, with a guide for each operating\nsystem. That guide for the latest and
  greatest official Microsoft\ndriver is\n[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server).\n\nI
  have tested the OS X instructions on my own machine.\n[This project's Dockerfile](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/blob/master/Dockerfile)\nfollows
  setup instructions for Linux, and\n[the AppVeyor file](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/blob/master/appveyor.yml)\nfollows
  the setup instructions for Windows.\n\nThere is a test program that comes with the
  package called `odbc`\nwhich accepts a connection string as its argument. You can
  use this to\ntest your connection easily.\n\n(Use `17` instead of `13` if that's
  the driver you installed.)\n\n    $ stack exec odbc 'DRIVER={ODBC Driver 13 for
  SQL Server};SERVER=192.168.99.101;Uid=SA;Pwd=Passw0rd;Encrypt=no'\n    > create
  table foo (i int)\n    Rows: 0\n    > insert into foo values (123123123)\n    Rows:
  0\n    > select * from foo\n    123123123\n    Rows: 1\n\n## Common issues\n\nCompilation
  on Linux/OS X may require a `odbcss.h` header file for type/constant definitions.
  To get this install the freetds package:\n\n* [Linux example](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/blob/efe81f7c17f5ff4c1cf8937577b32f049c0dd62b/Dockerfile#L15).\n*
  On OS X you can use `brew install freetds`.\n\nWindows should already have this
  file.\n\nIf you see an error like this:\n\n    [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open
  lib 'ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server' : file not found\n\nThen you might be trying
  to use the wrong driver. You might have\ninstalled version `17`, so change the string
  to `ODBC Driver 17 for\nSQL Server`.\n\nIf you see an error like this:\n\n    [unixODBC][Driver
  Manager]Data source name not found and no default driver specified\n\nThis is a
  terrible error message. If passing your DSN via a shell\nenvironment variable or
  argument, check that your input string isn't\nquoted e.g. `\"Driver=..\"` instead
  of `Driver=..` due to silly shell\nscripting quoting issues.\n\nIf you see an error
  like this on OS X with driver version 17,\n\n```\nlibc++abi.dylib: terminating with
  uncaught exception of type\nstd::runtime_error: collate_byname::collate_byname failed
  to construct\nfor C/en_AU.UTF-8/C/C/C/C\n```\n\nuse driver 13 or [see here for more
  detail](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/issues/17).\n"
