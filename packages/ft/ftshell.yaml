description: ! "\n  DESCRIPTION\n\nThis application is a shell-based user interface
  to the free-theorems\nlibrary. It allows to generate free theorems for nearly any
  Haskell\ntype expression including user-defined data types and type classes.\nSee
  the description of the free-theorems library for the restrictions.\n\n\n\n  DEPENDENCIES\n\nSee
  the file `ftshell.cabal' for dependencies. The dependency on \nShellac-readline
  may be dropped  which needs small changes in the\nfile `src/Settings.hs'.\n\n\n
  \ \n  INSTALL\n\nSince this application is cabalised, it uses the standard installation\nprocess.\n
  \ \n  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure\n  runhaskell Setup.lhs build\n  runhaskell
  Setup.lhs install\n\n\n\n  USAGE\n\nStart the application by entering `ftshell'.
  Further information is\nprovided by the application itself.\n\n\n"
