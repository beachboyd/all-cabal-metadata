synopsis: Extra tools for Nginx haskell module
changelog: |+
  ### 0.4.4.0

  - Using *WorkerProcessIsExiting* instead of *ThreadKilled* as required in
    *ngx-export 1.6.4*.

  ### 0.4.3.0

  - Function *exitWorkerProcess* was renamed to *restartWorkerProcess*.
  - A new function *finalizeHTTPRequest* was added.
  - Functions *terminateWorkerProcess* and *restartWorkerProcess* were
    reimplemented using API exceptions from package *ngx-export 1.6.3*, and
    therefore now they can be effectively used only in Haskell services.

  ### 0.4.2.3

  - Using *TypeApplications* instead of *PartialTypeSignatures* in examples.

  ### 0.4.2.0

  - More improvements in code generation of simple services.
  - Using *PartialTypeSignatures* in examples.

  ### 0.4.1.0

  - Improvements in code generation of simple services.

  ### 0.4.0.0

  - Now services with *SingleShotService* strategy run exactly two times during
    the lifetime of a worker process: this lets using them in initialization /
    cleanup flow. Accordingly, the *first-run* flag is passed to them again.
  - Added a number of combinators to facilitate creation of specialized services.
    They allow distinguishing between *ignition* and *deferred* services.

  ### 0.3.3.0

  - In case of unreadable configuration, terminate the worker process by throwing
    exception *TerminateWorkerProcess* which makes Nginx log the supplied message
    and exit. To use this exception, the constraint on the version of the package
    *ngx-export* was increased.

  ### 0.3.2.0

  - Do not pass the *first-run* flag to simple services with the
    *SingleShotService* sleeping strategy.

  ### 0.3.1.0

  - Names of the storages for custom types now contain the name of the service
    which makes it possible to use the same configuration type in multiple
    services.

  ### 0.3.0.0

  - Added readers of custom types consuming the Nginx request pointer at first.
  - Extended docs and examples.

  ### 0.2.1.1

  - Fixed examples of simple services handlers.

  ### 0.2.1.0

  - Derive *TimeInterval* from *Show*.
  - Extended docs and examples.

  ### 0.2.0.0

  - Added functions *readFromByteString* and *readFromByteStringAsJSON*.
  - Many bug fixes in the builder of simple services.

  ### 0.1.2.0

  - Added function *ngxRequestPtr*.

  ### 0.1.1.0

  - Re-export *CInt* and *CUInt* like in module *NgxExport* instead of
    *unsafePerformIO*.

  ### 0.1.0.0

  - Initial version.
