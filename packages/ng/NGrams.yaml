description: ! 'An n-gram is a natural language processing technique for determining,

  given a list of words and a phrase, the probability that each of the

  words given will follow in the phrase. The executable provided asks for

  a phrase and a list of alternate ending words. It also asks for the type

  of n-gram to create (e.g., bi-gram, tri-gram). The probability for each

  possible phrase is then calculated using Google search results.'
