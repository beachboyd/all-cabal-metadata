description: |-
  This package is part of the @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics optics>@
  package family.  It provides utilities for converting between the 'Optic' type
  defined by @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics optics>@ and the van
  Laarhoven representations of optics that require definitions outside of @base@
  (in particular isomorphisms and prisms).
