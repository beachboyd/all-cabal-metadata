description: ! 'A raw Haskell binding to OpenVG vector graphics API version

  1.0.1, specifically the ShivaVG-0.2.1 implementation.


  Following Sven Panne\''s OpenGL model this is essentially a 1:1

  mapping between the OpenVG C API and Haskell and is expected

  to be used in concert with the higher-level @OpenVG@ pacakge.


  Detailed install instructions for Windows (MinGW/MSYS) are

  included in the @OpenVG@ package.

  v0.1.0 to v0.2.0
