synopsis: OpenVG (ShivaVG-0.2.1) binding
changelog: ! "== OpenVG ==\n\nversion 0.7.0 (01 Jan 2014):\n  * Updated to work with
  GHC 7.6 and Platform 2013.2.0.0.\n\n  * Updated Windows install instructions.\n\nversion
  0.6.0 (17 Jan 2010):\n  * Revised the RenderingQuality module to use an opaque matrix\n
  \   type rather than a raw pointer. Acknowledgement - the code \n    and interface
  is derived from the Matrix class in HOpenGL.\n  \n  * Revised Image module - PixelData
  is now an opaque type rather\n    than a raw pointer.\n\n  * Work on Path module
  - pathBounds implemented. This module is\n    entirely untested and may change again
  in the future.\n\nversion 0.5.0 (16 Jan 2010):\n  * Split into 2 packages OpenVG
  (this package) and OpenVGRaw.\n\nversion 0.4.0 (13 Dec 2009):\n  * LinearGradient
  type changed to be Vector4 VGfloat.\n \n  * RadialGradient changed to (Vector4 VGfloat,
  VGfloat).\n\n  * Removed Marshal and Unmarshal type classes, marshallBool and \n
  \   unmarshalBool moved out of the BasicTypes module.\n\n  * Type change for colorRampStops.\n\n
  \ * Name change - maxStops changed to maxColorRampStops.\n\n  * PathType(..) changed
  to PathAbsRel(..).\n\n  * Substantial changes to Haddock docs.\n\n  * Error handling
  in VGU redone - the original code in \n    ErrorsInternal was taken wholesale from
  Sven Panne\\'s \n    OpenGL binding to help me bootstrap OpenVG binding. \n    Regrettably
  I forgot to replace it or attribute it -\n    I've now replaced it. Sincere apologies
  to Sven Panne.\n\nversion 0.3.0 (10 Dec 2009):\n  * Changes to use the split OpenGL
  packages \n\n  * Added type coercions for the Size data type (these \n    might
  not be ideal).\n\n\nversion 0.2.1 (10 Dec 2009):\n  * .cabal file upper bounds for
  OpenGL and GLUT\n\n  * Windows installation instructions updated.\n\n\nversion 0.2
  (07 Jul 2009):\n  * Updated to support ShivaVG version 0.2.1\n\n  * ShivaVG 0.2.1
  add support for\n    - vgHardwareQuery \n\n  * ShivaVG 0.2.1 stubbed a number of
  functions that were previously missing\n    - vgMask\n    - vgChildImage\n    -
  vgGetParent\n    - vgColorMatrix\n    - vgConvolve\n    - vgSeparableConvolve\n
  \   - vgGaussianBlur\n    - vgLookup\n    - vgLookupSingle\n\n    - vguComputeWarpQuadToSquare\n
  \   - vguComputeWarpSquareToQuad\n    - vguComputeWarpQuadToQuad\n \nversion 0.1
  (02 Feb 2009):\n  * Support for ShivaVG version 0.2.0 \n"

description: ! "Haskell bindings to ShivaVG (OpenVG implementation).\n\nHaskell OpenVG
  0.1 binds to ShivaVG-0.2.0\nHaskell OpenVG 0.2 binds to ShivaVG-0.2.1\nHaskell OpenVG
  0.2.1 binds to ShivaVG-0.2.1\nHaskell OpenVG 0.3.0 binds to ShiaVG-0.2.1 \n(thanks
  to Stefan Kirsten for the patches).\nHaskell OpenVG 0.4.0 binds to ShivaVG-0.2.1\n\n\nI've
  tested the bindings on both Windows XP (MinGW/Msys) \nand MacOSX Leopard.\n\nOn
  MacOSX both the 0.2 and 0.1 bindings seem work on \ntheir respective libraries.\n\nOn
  Windows the version 0.4.0 bindings now work, though please \nmake sure your Haskell
  OpenGL binding works first before trying \nthe OpenVG binding.\n\n\n\nOTHER PROBLEMS:\n\nMacOSX
  - runhaskell / GHCi freeze the shell when you try to run\nthe example TestVgu.hs.
  You will have to compile it first.\n\nWindows - running the test through GHCi kills
  the GHCi session\nwhen you close the display window. It's better to run through
  \nrunhaskell.\n\nShiva-VG (the C Library) should install quite easily on MacOSX
  - \nI installed it with the usual `configure`, `make` & \n`make install`. I would
  imagine Linux is easy too. Windows isn't \nall that easy - but there are instructions
  in the file \n`InstallWindows.txt`.\n\n\nOn all platforms you will need OpenGL and
  GLUT and the Haskell\nbindings to OpenGL and GLUT installed and working, these are\npart
  of the Platform.\n\n"
