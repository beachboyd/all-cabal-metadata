description: ! '# What''s Graphics.OpenSCAD


  This is a library whose primary component is an algebraic data type

  for describing [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) models, and a function

  that converts that data type into a string. There are convenience

  functions to make building the model easier.


  ## What''s different


  Given the primitive and quirky nature of the OpenSCAD language, the

  idea of "using OpenSCAD" as an assembler is both obvious, and promoted

  in lieu of adding major extensions to OpenSCAD. So there are a number

  of such projects, for a variety of languages.


  Any compiler that generated "assembler" that caused the assembler

  program to generate errors would be considered buggy. However, none of

  the alternative projects I looked at seemed to do anything about that

  (my apologies if I missed one - I only looked at languages I was

  interested in using). Graphics.OpenSCAD takes the attitude that errors

  from OpenSCAD on the generated code are errors in

  Graphics.OpenSCAD. If you manage to generate code that causes OpenSCAD

  to issue an error message, please open an issue here.
