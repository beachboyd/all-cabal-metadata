description: ! "        This is a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto>\n
  \       that currently does fingerprint generation, signature generation, and\n
  \       signature verification (for RSA keys only).\n        .\n        It is indended
  to be used with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp>\n        .\n        It
  is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.\n        .\n        >
