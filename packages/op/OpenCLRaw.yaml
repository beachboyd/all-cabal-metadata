description: ! 'The OpenCL system for open heterogenous data parallel supercomputing.

  **General Notes on the differences between Haskell and the OpenCL-C implementation**

  * Side-effectful procedures capable of returning an error code only return a Maybe
  ErrorCode, with Nothing returned upon success

  * Procedures which follow the pattern of returning a pointer to an object and taking
  a final parameter as an error code instead return Either ErrorCode ObjectType

  * Procedures which prefix with clGetInfo* merely take the object, parameter name,
  and parameter size to allocate. The allocation handled by OpenCLRaw and returned
  as a Haskell-managed ForeignPtr ()

  * Enumerations and constants are replaced by newtypes for the sake of type-safety.'
