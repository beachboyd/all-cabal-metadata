description: ! 'An abstract interface to highly-parameterizable queues/deques.


  Background: There exists a feature space for queues that extends between:


  * simple, single-ended, non-concurrent, bounded queues


  * double-ended, threadsafe, growable queues


  ... with important points inbetween (such as

  the queues used for work-stealing).


  This package includes an interface for Deques that allows the

  programmer to use a single API for all of the above, while using the

  type-system to select an efficient implementation given the

  requirements (using type families).


  This package also includes a simple reference implementation based

  on ''IORef'' and "Data.Sequence".'
