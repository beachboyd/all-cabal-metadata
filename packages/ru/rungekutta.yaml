description: ! "This is a small module collecting about a dozen Runge-Kutta methods\nof
  different orders, along with a couple of programs to exercise them.\n\nBuild and
  run testrk, volterra, volterra2, and arenstorf:\n\no   testrk exercises all of the
  methods in a non-adaptive way,\n    solving a test problem with a known analytic
  solution,\n    to check convergence. (This was what first indicated that\n    there
  was a problem with the Fehlberg 7(8) listing in HNW.)\n\no   volterra uses a non-adaptive
  method to solve the Lotka-Volterra\n    equations from t=0 to t=40: either from
  a built-in starting point,\n    or from a starting point specified on the command
  line.\n\no   volterra2 does the same, except it uses an adaptive solver\n\no   arenstorf
  solves the restricted 3-body problem (earth+moon+satellite)\n    using an adaptive
  solver with some specific initial conditions\n    which yield periodic orbits\n\nThe
  volterra2 and arenstorf examples use an \"oracle\" function to\ndecide what is a
  good step size. Right now that oracle function is in\neach test file; arguably it
  should be in the RungeKutta module.\nEventually it will be, but I haven't spent
  much time yet on making\nthat oracle especially good.\n"
