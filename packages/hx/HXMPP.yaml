description: ! "HXMPP aims to be an easy-to-use XMPP library for Haskell. We have
  just\nreleased an initial prototyped version with the following features:\n\n  *
  DIGEST-MD5 SASL Authentication\n  * Concurrent and Event-based API for XMPP Client
  Developers\n  * Support for Info/Query and Presence Stanzas\n  * Interoperable XML
  Parsing (Using enumerator, xml-enumerator and xml-types)\n\nPlease note that we
  are not recommending anyone to use HXMPP at this time as\nitâ€™s still in an experimental
  stage and will have its API and data types\nmodified frequently. We have scheduled
  the first beta release for the 4th of\nMay. That being said, if you are interested
  to use HXMPP anyway, feel free to\ncontact the Pontarius project and we will try
  to help you get started.\n\nWe are currently working on cleaning up the code, securing
  the client-to-server\nstream using TLS and having the library support all of RFC
  3920: XMPP Core (by\nfor example supporting message stanzas).\n\nWe will release
  the next version, 0.1 Alpha 2, on the 23rd of March.\n\nLook at the Pontarius web
  site <http://www.pontarius.org/>, the HXMPP web page\n<http://www.pontarius.org/sub-projects/hxmpp/>
  and the HXMPP Hackage page\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HXMPP/> for more
  information.\n"
