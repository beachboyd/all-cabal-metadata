  ## Overview

  `type-errors` is a collection of tools for writing better, more ergonomic, type
  errors. Some of the more interesting features are the ability to observe
  stuckedness and phantomness, as well as perform substitutions over types.

  For more information, check out the [haddock
  documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-errors/docs/Type-Errors.html).


  ## Acknowledgments

  This project wouldn't be possible without the help of two amazing people:

  * [ksongor](https://kcsongor.github.io/) who came up with the original
    technology behind this library.
  * [Lysxia](https://blog.poisson.chat/) for articulating the approach to making
    `IfStuck` work for things of all kinds, and for helping me with the
    substitution machinery.
