description: ! 'TypedFlow is a typed, higher-order frontend to TensorFlow and a high-level
  library for deep-learning.


  The main design principles are:


  - To make the parameters of layers explicit. This choice makes sharing of parameters
  explicit and allows to implement "layers" as pure functions.


  - To provide as precise as possible types. Functions are explicit about the shapes
  and elements of the tensors that they manipulate (they are often polymorphic in
  shapes and elements though.)


  - To let combinators be as transparent as possible. If a NN layers is a simple tensor
  transformation it will be exposed as such.'
