description: ! 'Maps where keys are types and values can have types depending on their
  keys.


  * "Data.TypeMap.Dynamic": Simple maps using the ''Typeable'' mechanism,

  tracking keys at run time.

  "Data.TypeMap.Dynamic.Alt" is an alternative API based on type applications

  rather than passing proxies, available from GHC 8.0.1.


  * "Data.TypeMap.Vector": Only available from GHC 8.0.1. Maps whose domains

  are given in their types for compile-time verification and fast indexing.

  Two more variants with the same API: "Data.TypeMap.List" uses lists and

  "Data.TypeMap.Map" uses maps (from ''containers''), trading indexing speed

  for for more efficient creation and modification. "Data.TypeMap.Static"

  exports some operations on type lists.'
