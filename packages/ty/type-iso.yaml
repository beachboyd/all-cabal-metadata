synopsis: Typeclasses for injective relations and isomorphisms between types.
changelog: ! "1.0.0.0 Renamed 'isoFrom' and 'isoTo' to just 'from' and 'to', flipped
  the type argument order to allow specifying the target type first.\r\n"

description: ! 'This package defines \"can be cast to\" relations between types: two
  types a and b are an instance of Injective if there''s an injective function from
  a to b. If there is also an injective function from b to a, a and b are instances
  of Iso, meaning that one can convert back and forth losslessly (up to some appropriate
  notion of equality). The main purpose of this little package is to provide easy
  casting between the common string types (String, strict/lazy Text) and numeric types
  (Integers, Peano numbers), without having to look up the names of the various conversion
  functions all the time.'
