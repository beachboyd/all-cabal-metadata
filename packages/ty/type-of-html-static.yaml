description: ! '# Type of html static


  This little companion library of `Type of html` provides just two

  little function: `static :: Document a => a -> Q Exp`.  Using this

  template haskell function on any part of your html document will

  escape, render and lift to a Symbol at compile time.


  It increases performance a lot by avoiding any runtime computation.

  By producing Proxy Symbol, it will fuse at compiletime with adjacent

  elements in your document.


  `optimize :: Q Exp -> Q Exp` takes an quoted definition of a html

  document and tries to convert all literals to compile time escaped

  Proxy Symbol.  It is less powerfull than `static` but more convenient.
