description: ! 'This package provides high-level combinators for working

  with inductive structures --- that is, structures tagged

  with a phantom type-level natural number.  Combinators

  are provided for building up a structure from seed data

  using induction, tearing down a structure to obtain a

  result, and inductively transforming one structure into

  another with the same size.


  This package uses the type-level-natural-number package for

  its type-level representations of the natural numbers.  The

  only non-Haskell 2010 extension it needs is Rank2Types.'
