  \  Added `singSome`/`someSing` and `singWit1`/`wit1Sing`, to convert between\n    the
  *singletons* types `SomeSing` and `SingInstance` and their more generic\n    representations
  in *type-combinators*, `Some Sing` and `Wit1 Sing`.\n\nVersion 0.2.0.0\n---------------\n\n*Jan

  \  Gathered together the many two-way conversion functions into a typeclass,\n    `TC`.\n\nVersion

  ==========================


  Conversions between data-types in *[type-combinators][]* and singletons from

  *[singletons][]* and orphan instances.


  [type-combinators]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-combinators

  [singletons]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons


  There''s a lot of overlap in functionality between the two libraries.  I often

  use both of them together side-by-side to do different things, but there is

  some friction the process of converting between the identical data types that

  both libraries have, and between similar typeclasses.  This library attempts to

  ease that friction by providing conversion functions between identical data

  types and also many of the appropriate orphan typeclass instances.
