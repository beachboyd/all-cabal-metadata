  # Changelog for squeather

  ## Version 0.4.0.0, February 22, 2020

  * Changed Database and Statement types so they clean
  up after themselves, so there is no need to (and, indeed,
  then cannot be) closed or finalized as they do it themselves.

  * Changed OpenFlags and associated types to make
  API self-documenting

  * Added compile-time option for threaded mode into package.yaml
  (though this is the default, so nothing should change from the
  user's persepctive)

  * open function now calls sqlite3_initialize (this should
  not result in any user-visible changes)
