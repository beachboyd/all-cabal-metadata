description: ! 'Parse ghc and cabal error messages and give their causes for easier
  resolution.


  Just pass the error message to ''errorCauses'' and get a list of possible explanations/resolutions
  (''ErrorCause'')


  Check the test suite for examples.


  This functionality was originally developed in Java as part of EclipseFP but was
  rewritten

  in Haskell in the hope it can be useful to other IDE tools or GHC library wrappers.'
