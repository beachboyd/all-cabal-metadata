description: ! 'errno is a small utility to supplement the FFI.

  Many C functions will return a special Int if an error

  has occurred, and the withErrno* functions allow you

  to lift them into the ErrorT String transformer.

  I found this in some cases useful for when I wanted

  to handle errors from both C & Haskell on equal

  footing.'
