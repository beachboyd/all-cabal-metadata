description: |-
  erd transforms a plain text description of a relational database schema to a
  graphical representation of that schema. It is intended that the graph make
  use of common conventions when depicting entity-relationship diagrams,
  including modeling the cardinality of relationships between entities.

  A quick example that transforms an `er` file to a PDF:

  > $ curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BurntSushi/erd/master/examples/simple.er' > simple.er
  > $ cat simple.er
  > # Entities are declared in '[' ... ']'. All attributes after the entity header
  > # up until the end of the file (or the next entity declaration) correspond
  > # to this entity.
  > [Person]
  > *name
  > height
  > weight
  > +birth_location_id
  >
  > [Location]
  > *id
  > city
  > state
  > country
  >
  > # Each relationship must be between exactly two entities, which need not
  > # be distinct. Each entity in the relationship has exactly one of four
  > # possible cardinalities:
  > #
  > # Cardinality    Syntax
  > # 0 or 1         0
  > # exactly 1      1
  > # 0 or more      *
  > # 1 or more      +
  > Person *--1 Location
  > $ erd -i simple.er -o simple.pdf

  The PDF should now contain a graph that looks like this:

  examples and instructions on how to write ER files.
