description: ! "These files implement a very simple facility for finding out\na \"high-water
  mark\" in the amount of memory your GHC-Haskell\nprogram is using. It only counts
  memory managed by GHC's storage\nmanager, so, as Simon Marlow says:\n\n   Note that
  this only counts memory allocated by the GHC storage manager;\n   it doesn't include
  the data segments, malloc(), the C stack, or other\n   mmap()'d stuff.  Be careful
  if your program is using any of these other\n   allocation methods (perhaps via
  an external library through the FFI).\n\nThe file Main.hs is provided here as an
  example, to compile it, use:\n\n   ghc HighWaterMark.hs mblocks.c Main.hs \n\nCheers,\nBernie
  Pope.\n"
