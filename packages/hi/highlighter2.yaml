description: ! 'It''s fork from original highlighter, with some changes for performance.

  This version work faster (5 - 10 times) for big files (> 1000 lines of code).


  Processes source code using tons of lexers, tokenizing it and formatting it as e.g.
  HTML.


  Very similar to the Python Pygments library; many lexers directly converted from
  it.'
