description: ! 'This module provides an implementation of the Apriori algorithm for
  association rule mining. It uses Control.Parallel.Strategies for parallelism and
  allows the user to provide custom selection criteria. See hinduce-examples for an
  example.

  hInduce is a framework for knowledge discovery/machine learning/data mining. It
  has a modular design that hopefully will invite others to re-use and build upon
  the interface. This module currently deviates from this concept, because we had
  a different focus and too limited time budget to investigate other rule mining algorithms
  and find any use for this kind of abstraction.'
