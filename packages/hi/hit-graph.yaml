changelog: ! "The changes are recorded by the version control system, Darcs. To see
  a log\nquickly from the terminal, run:\n\n  $ darcs changes --repo http://hub.darcs.net/fr33domlover/hit-graph\n\nThere
  is also a web interface at <http://hub.darcs.net> which, among other\nthings, can
  display the history log.\n\nTo see the log in a local clone, first get a copy of
  the repository if you\nhaven't yet:\n\n  $ darcs get http://hub.darcs.net/fr33domlover/hit-graph\n\nThen
  move into the newly created directory and run darcs:\n\n  $ cd hit-graph\n  $ darcs
  changes\n"
