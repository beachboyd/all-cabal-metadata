description: ! "hledger-interest\n================\n\nhledger-interest is a small
  command-line utility based on [Simon\nMichael's hlegder library](http://hledger.org/).
  Its purpose is to\ncompute interest for a given ledger account. Using command line
  flags,\nthe program can be configured to use various [day counting\nconventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention),
  such as\n\"act/act\", \"30/360\", \"30E/360\", and \"30/360isda\". Furthermore,
  it\nsupports several of different interest schemes, i.e. annual interest\nwith a
  fixed rate and the scheme mandated by the German law [ยง 288 BGB\nVerzugszinsen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verzugszinssatz).
  Extending\nsupport for other schemes is fairly easy, but currently requires hacking\nthe
  source code.\n\nAn overview over the available run-time options can be displayed
  by\nrunning \"`hleder-interest --help`\":\n\n    Usage: hledger-interest [OPTION...]
  ACCOUNT\n      -v          --verbose         echo input ledger to stdout (default)\n
  \     -q          --quiet           don't echo input ledger to stdout\n                  --today
  \          compute interest up until today\n      -f FILE     --file=FILE       input
  ledger file (pass '-' for stdin)\n      -s ACCOUNT  --source=ACCOUNT  interest source
  account\n      -t ACCOUNT  --target=ACCOUNT  interest target account\n                  --act
  \            use 'act' day counting convention\n                  --30-360          use
  '30/360' day counting convention\n                  --30E-360         use '30E/360'
  day counting convention\n                  --30E-360isda     use '30E/360isda' day
  counting convention\n                  --constant=RATE   constant interest rate\n
  \                 --annual=RATE     annual interest rate\n                  --bgb288
  \         compute interest according to German BGB288\n\nWhen run, hledger-interest
  reads the [ledger\nfile](http://hledger.org/MANUAL.html#file-format) designated
  by the\n`--file` flag and filters all transactions that change the account\nspecified
  on the command line. All other accounts will be ignored. Every\ntime a transaction
  modifies the given account's balance -- thereby\nchanging the amount of money that
  earns interest --, hledger-interest\ntransfers the interest that accrued so far.
  Interest will be debited\nfrom the account designed by the `--source` flag and credited
  to the\naccount designed by the `--target` flag.\n\n## Examples\n\nSuppose that
  you've loaned 1000 Euro from your bank at an annual\ninterest rate of 5%, and that
  you would like to see how interest\ndevelops over time. Then you would create a
  ledger file, say\n`loan.ledger`, that looks something like this:\n\n    2010/09/26
  Loan\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR 1000.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\nNow,
  `ledger-interest` is run to determine the interest up until today:\n\n    $ hledger-interest
  -f loan.ledger --act --annual=0.05 --today -s Expenses:Interest -t Liabilities:Loan:Interest
  Liabilities:Loan\n    2010/09/26 Loan\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR
  1000.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n    2010/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -1000.00
  over 96 days\n        Liabilities:Loan:Interest       EUR -13.15\n        Expenses:Interest\n\n
  \   2011/08/22 5.00% interest for EUR -1000.00 over 234 days\n        Liabilities:Loan:Interest
  \      EUR -32.05\n        Expenses:Interest\n\nNote a separate credit account for
  the interest was chosen:\n`Liabilities:Loan:Interest`. Consequently, interest accrued
  in one\ninterest period does *not* earn interest in the following periods. If\ninterest
  is credited to the main account instead, that behavior changes:\n\n    $ hledger-interest
  -f loan.ledger --act --annual=0.05 --today -s Expenses:Interest -t Liabilities:Loan
  Liabilities:Loan\n    2010/09/26 Loan\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR
  1000.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n    2010/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -1000.00
  over 96 days\n        Liabilities:Loan                EUR -13.15\n        Expenses:Interest\n\n
  \   2011/08/22 5.00% interest for EUR -1013.15 over 234 days\n        Liabilities:Loan
  \               EUR -32.48\n        Expenses:Interest\n\nOf course, loans are supposed
  to be paid back, and these payments change\nthe amount of interest accrued. Suppose
  that `load.ledger` would be\nextended by the following transactions:\n\n    2010/12/11
  Payment\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR -150.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n
  \   2011/03/07 Payment\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR -300.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n
  \   2011/08/21 Payment\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR -150.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\nThen
  interest would develop as follows:\n\n    $ hledger-interest -f loan.ledger --act
  --annual=0.05 -s Expenses:Interest -t Liabilities:Loan Liabilities:Loan\n    2010/09/26
  Loan\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR 1000.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n
  \   2010/12/11 5.00% interest for EUR -1000.00 over 76 days\n        Liabilities:Loan
  \               EUR -10.41\n        Expenses:Interest\n\n    2010/12/11 Payment\n
  \       Assets:Bank                     EUR -150.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n
  \   2010/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -860.41 over 20 days\n        Liabilities:Loan
  \               EUR -2.36\n        Expenses:Interest\n\n    2011/03/07 5.00% interest
  for EUR -862.77 over 66 days\n        Liabilities:Loan                EUR -7.80\n
  \       Expenses:Interest\n\n    2011/03/07 Payment\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR
  -300.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\n    2011/08/21 5.00% interest for EUR -570.57
  over 167 days\n        Liabilities:Loan                EUR -13.05\n        Expenses:Interest\n\n
  \   2011/08/21 Payment\n        Assets:Bank                     EUR -150.00\n        Liabilities:Loan\n\nLast
  but not least, there is a special case known as \"Verzugszinsen\" in\nGerman law,
  which applies when someone is supposed to pay a bill, but\nfails to do so on time.
  For every day past the deadline, interest\naccrues according to terms specified
  in [ยง 247\nBGB](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__247.html). The command line\nflag
  `--bgb288` enables this scheme in `hledger-interest`.\n\nLet's assume that customer
  ACME is supposed to pay 35 Euro by\n2010/09/15, but the money actually arrives almost
  half a year late:\n\n    2010/09/15 Services rendered to Customer ACME\n        ACME
  \                           1 hour @ EUR 35.00\n        Receivable:ACME\n\n    2011/03/17
  ACME\n        ACME                            EUR 35.00\n        Receivable:ACME\n\nAccording
  to German law, you are entitled to the following interest:\n\n    $ hledger-interest
  -f acme.ledger --quiet --bgb288 -s Income:Interest -t Receivable:ACME:Interest Receivable:ACME\n
  \   2010/12/31 5.12% interest for EUR 35.00 over 107 days\n        Receivable:ACME:Interest
  \       EUR 0.53\n        Income:Interest\n\n    2011/03/17 5.12% interest for EUR
  35.00 over 76 days\n        Receivable:ACME:Interest        EUR 0.37\n        Income:Interest\n\nSo,
  if you're smart, then you'll book the payment so that the accrued\ninterest is paid
  *first*:\n\n    2011/03/17 ACME\n        ACME                            EUR 35.00\n
  \       Receivable:ACME:Interest        EUR -0.90\n        Receivable:ACME\n\nThis
  gives the following transaction history for the ACME account:\n\n    $ hledger-interest
  -f acme.ledger --bgb288 -s Income:Interest -t Receivable:ACME:Interest Receivable:ACME
  |\n      hledger -f - reg Receivable:ACME\n    2010/09/15 Services rendered .. Receivable:ACME
