description: ! "Notes on repository.\n\nThis repository hosts currently a fork of
  Dominic Orchard's syntax-trees\nproject residing in a VCS repository, git in particular,
  with the following\nbranches:\n\n * master: Currently the branch for the actual
  fork, for the\n     syntax-trees-fork-bairyn package.  Version tags refer to commits
  in this\n     branch.\n * cherry-picked-build-fixes: Contains the initial import
  of the syntax-trees\n     package with just build fixes cherry picked in.\n * cherry-picked-build-and-warning-fixes:
  Based on cherry-picked-build-fixes,\n     this branch adds fixes to warnings, an
  addition of the \"-Wall\" flag for\n     GHC so that warnings are emitted during
  the build process, and the\n     correction of \"template-haskell\" typos.\n * fork-no-rename:
  Based on master, and adds commits that reverses the renaming\n     of the fork and
  module names.\n"
