description: ! "system-lifted\n=============\n\nLifted versions of Haskell System
  functions.\n\nWhile haskell promotes the use of ```Maybe``` and ```Either``` as
  smart ways of dealing with errors, I found that the \nsupport for their Monad Transformers
  counter-parts is less than stellar.\n\nWhile some packages like [Errors](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/errors-1.4.5/docs/Control-Error-Util.html)
  simplify\nthis, they still add a lot of boilerplate to the code.\n\nThe goal of
  this project started out as a way to write cleaner directory related code in either
  one of the _error related_\nmonad transformers, namely ```EitherT```, ```ErrorT```
  or ```MaybeT``` (non-determinism and ```ListT``` are not yet supported). \n\nThis
  is achieved through typeclasses, and thus, by simply declaring some simple _template
  haskell_ at the start of a file:\n\n```\ntype EitherIOText       = EitherT Text\n\nderiveSystemLiftedErrors
  \"DisallowIOE [HardwareFault]\" ''EitherIOText\nderiveSystemDirectory   ''EitherIOText\n```\n\nOne
  could then write code like this:\n\n```\ngetXdgConfigFolder :: EitherT IOException
  IO FilePath\ngetXdgConfigFolder = isRW =<< getEnv \"XDG_CONFIG_HOME\"\n```\n\nCurrently
  the ```System.Directory``` and ```System.Environment``` are fully supported, and
  there is partial support for ```System.Unix.Users```.\n\nMore examples and wider
  ```System.``` support is planned. Contribuitions are welcomed.\n\n\n"
