description: ! 'Simple library for using the system''s monotonic clock.  This library
  is

  geared toward programs that need to run for long periods of time.  It does

  not (necessarily) provide high-resolution timing.


  * On Windows, this uses @GetTickCount64@, but falls back to

  @GetTickCount@ if it is not available.  @GetTickCount64@ was

  introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

  Support for @QueryPerformanceCounter@ is also available, but is not

  used by default, as it is less accurate in the long run than

  @GetTickCount@.


  * On Linux, this uses @clock_gettime@ with @CLOCK_MONOTONIC@.


  Release history:


  [0.2] Update driver API (@SystemClock@) to prevent cumulative precision loss.


  [0.1] Initial release.'
