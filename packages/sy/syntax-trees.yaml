description: ! 'Provides an instance that translates

  haskell-src-exts expression trees into Template Haskell expression

  trees in a way that depends only on the haskell-src-exts syntax tree

  and agreement on the pretty-printed representation of

  Haskell between haskell-src-exts pretty-printer and

  Template Haskell quotations (as opposed to depending on

  both TH and haskell-src-exts syntax tree representations).


  Instead of converting between data types,

  haskell-src-exts syntax trees are pretty-printed and wrapped in

  a TH quotation which is then interpreted as a Haskell program,

  yielding a TH Exp tree. Free variables in the haskell-src-exts tree are

  preserved by lifting them to TH splices prior to pretty-printing.
