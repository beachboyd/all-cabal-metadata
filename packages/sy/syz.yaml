  Scrap Your Zippers: A Generic Zipper for Heterogeneous Types.\n Michael D. Adams.
  \ WGP '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGPLAN\n workshop on Generic programming,
  2010.\n\nIt defines the Zipper type permitting zipper traversals over arbitrary\ninstances
  of Data.  See the paper for an introduction on using it.\n\nThe paper is available
  at:\n http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~adamsmd/papers/scrap_your_zippers/\n\nWhile the
  core zipper data structures are quite solid, the surrounding\nlibrary design is
  likely to change based on feedback from the\ncommunity.  So if you find any bugs
  or would like to see something\nchanged, please let me know.\n"
