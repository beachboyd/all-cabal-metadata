description: ! 'A library that supports deriving of pretty printing functions on data
  types.


  The interfaces of pretty printer used are based on that introduced in the paper:

  Philip Wadler, A Prettier Printer, The Fun of Programming,

  Cornerstones of Computing (2003): 223-243.

  <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf original paper>


  The form of generic feature used is based on that introduced in the paper:

  Magalhaes, et al., A Generic Deriving Mechanism for Haskell,

  3''rd ACM Symposium on Haskell, pp. 37-48, September 2010,

  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1863523.1863529>.

  The necessary information of implementation of GHC.Generics is described here:

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/GHC-Generics.html#g:1>.


  The implementation of deriving part of API is based on that designed in the library:
