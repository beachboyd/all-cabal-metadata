description: ! 'so far, this package just provides two representations for linear
  programs: "Numeric.Limp.Program", which is what I expect end-users to use, and

  "Numeric.Limp.Canon", which is simpler, but would be less nice for writing linear
  programs.

  see the limp-cbc package for a simple solver.'
