synopsis: Use SMT solvers to solve linear systems over integers and rationals
changelog: ! "* Hackage: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linearEqSolver>\n* GitHub:
  \ <http://github.com/LeventErkok/linearEqSolver>\n\n* Latest Hackage released version:
  2.0\n\n### Version 2.0, 2017-10-25\n\n  * Use defaultSMTConfig exported from SBV\n
  \ * All-solution variants now take the max-number of solutions requested,\n    following
  the corresponding changes in SBV itself. Thanks to Mitchell Rosen\n    for reporting.\n\n###
  Version 1.3, 2014-08-27\n\n  * Use the Solver type from SBV directly for picking
  the solver,\n    avoiding bit-rot.\n  * Adjust SBV dependency to >= 3.1, to get
  proper access to\n    Solver type\n\n### Version 1.2, 2013-01-02\n\n  * Allow both
  CVC4 and Z3 to be used as the SMT solver.\n  * Adjust SBV dependency to >= 2.9,
  to get access to CVC4.\n\n### Version 1.1, 2012-10-22\n\n  * Add solvers over rationals,
  in addition to just integers.\n  * Adjust SBV dependency to >= 2.7 as we depend
  on the new Real\n    instance for the AlgReal type.\n\n### Version 1.0, 2012-10-18\n\n
  \ * Initial release, contains solver for integer linear equations.\n"

description: ! '## linearEqSolver


  Solve systems of linear equations, using SMT solvers. Both integer only solutions
  and solutions

  over rationals are supported. Either single solutions, or all solutions can be computed.


  The hackage site http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linearEqSolver is the best place
  for details on the API and the example use cases.
