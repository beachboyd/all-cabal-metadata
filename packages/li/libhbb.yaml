changelog: ! "\nVersion 0.4.1.0\n---------------\n - Adding support for inlining value
  bindings with guards or *where*\n   expressions. If such a value bindings is encountered,
  a trivial *case*\n   expression is added `case () of () | ...\"`.\n - Fixing a bug
  that prevented functions with one match and a single parameter\n   to be inlined
  correctly. In this case a prefix like `\\a case a of` has been\n   produced, which
  is invalid as `->` is missing.\n\nVersion 0.4.0.2\n---------------\n\n - Fixing
  a bug in the modes *inline* and *smart-inline* which caused them to\n   produce
  a wrong representation for small functions that have no leading case\n   expression.
  The parameters of these function were always aggregated to\n   tuples.\n - Adding
  CHANGELOG.md and README.md to cabal package.\n\nVersion 0.4.0.1\n---------------\n\n
  - The modes *locate*, *inline* and *smart-inline* are now able to\n   inline/locate
  functions that are defined in infix notation.\n\nVersion 0.4.0.0\n----------------\n\n
  - Added the integration mode *apply-ttree*.\n - The modes *inline* and *smart-inline*
  are now able converting a *where*\n   expression to a *let* expression if this makes
  it possible to omit a leading\n   *case* expression. The result is a much shorter
  lambda function.\n"

description: ! '# **hbb**: Extraordinary Haskell programming


  This project aims to create a tool which should be easily embeddable in text

  editors to assist them to provide extraordinary editing features for the

  Haskell programming language. To archieve this, the tool is based on the

  library of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).


  The name **hbb** is short for *h*askell *b*usy *b*ee and should remind one of

  the programmers using it. It consists of the library *hbb* and a command line

  tool which has the name *libhbb-cli*. *libhbb-cli* has been chosen because in

  another repository the features of (the library) *hbb* and *ghc-mod* are merged

  into an executable *hbb* which provides (many more) features than *libhbb-cli*.


  One outstanding feature of *hbb* is is the possibility to inline a function

  binding.
