description: |-
  The term /numerical linear algebra/ is often used almost
  synonymous with /matrix modifications/. However, what's interesting
  for most applications are really just /points in some vector space/
  and linear mappings between them, not matrices (which represent
  points or mappings, but inherently depend on a particular choice
  of basis / coordinate system).

  This library implements the crucial LA operations like solving
  linear equations and eigenvalue problems, without requiring
  that the vectors are represented in some particular basis. Apart
  from conceptual elegance (only operations that are actually
  geometrically sensible will typecheck – this is far stronger than
  just confirming that the dimensions match, as some other libraries
  do), this also opens up good optimisation possibilities: the
  vectors can be unboxed, use dedicated sparse compression, possibly
  carry out the computations on accelerated hardware (GPU etc.).
  The spaces can even be infinite-dimensional (e.g. function spaces).

  The linear algebra algorithms in this package only require the
  vectors to support fundamental operations like addition, scalar
  products, double-dual-space coercion and tensor products; none of
  this requires a basis representation.
