description: ! '@libarchive-conduit@ reads archives with @libarchive@. All of the
  many

  formats understood by @libarchive@ are supported. Resource use is

  managed in Haskell with the @conduit@ library. The interface is very

  simple; archives are read from disk and their contents are presende as

  a stream of pairs @(FilePath, ByteString)@ of the path to each file

  and its contents, respectively.'
