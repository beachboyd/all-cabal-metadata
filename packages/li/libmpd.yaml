synopsis: An MPD client library.
changelog: "* v0.9.3.0 2021-01-02\n    - Drop support for GHC < 8.4, require base
  > 4.11.\n    - Bump `cabal-version` to 2.4.\n    - Add `Ord` instance for `PlaylistName`,
  `Path`, and `Value`\n    - Add support for MPD 0.21 style filters to the `Query`
  type,\n      see [Filters](https://www.musicpd.org/doc/html/protocol.html#filters)
  in the MPD protocol documentation. \n      Implemented through the added combinators
  `/=?`, `%?`, `~?`, `/~?`, `qNot`, `qModSince`, `qFile`, `qBase`.\n    \n* v0.9.2.0
  2020-10-02\n    - New command: `seekCur`\n    - Add `newtype Sign` to pass positive
  numbers to `MPDArg` with leading `+/-`.\n    - Add monadic versions of `deleteRange`
  and `moveRange` commands (previously\n      only had applicative versions)\n    -
  Deprecate `<&>`, use `<>` instead. `<&>` will be removed in the next major version.\n\n*
  v0.9.1.0 2020-01-27\n    - Support partition in Network.MPD.Status\n    - Ignore
  unknown key-value pairs in Network.MPD.status so that it breaks much less often.\n\n*
  v0.9.0.10 2019-10-06\n    - Port it for newer network library\n\n* v0.9.0, 2014-09-21\n
  \   - New commands: `deleteRange`, `moveRange`, `playlistInfoRange`,\n      `searchAdd`,
  `searchAddpl`.\n    - Fix `playlistId` and `list`\n    - Add Mixramp commands\n
  \   - Support for MPD 0.17\n    - Support for missing metadata keys.\n    - Sticker
  idle events\n    - Subscription and message events\n    - New applicative interface
  which allows combining arbitrary commands\n      into command lists (sol).\n    -
  Consistent typing for song positions (sol).\n    - Command definitions closer to
  the MPD spec; compound commands\n      have been moved to `N.M.C.Extensions`.\n
  \   - `Status.{stUpdatingDb,stTime,stBitrate,stVolume` are now `Maybe`\n    - `MonadMPD.getHandle`
  has been removed\n    - Re-connect and retry on `ResourceVanished` (e.g., when the\n
  \     connection times out).\n\n* v0.8.0, 2012-04-21\n    - Use bytestring for wire
  communication (sol)\n    - Increased type safety (sol)\n    - Improved memory usage
  (sol)\n    - `lsinfo` supports playlists (nandykins)\n    - `idle` now takes a list
  of subsystems (sol)\n    - `currentSong` works when playback is stopped (sol)\n
  \   - Fixes failure on songs without associated paths (sol)\n    - `LsResult` replaces
  `EntryType` (nandykins)\n    - hspec based testing added to the test-suite\n    -
  More extensive parser testing\n    - `MPDError` now has an `Exception` instance\n
  \   - Lower bound on Cabal bumped to 1.10\n\n* v0.7.2, 2012-02-13\n    - Release
  connections. Reported by Kanisterschleife on GitHub.\n    - Some minor internal

  \   - Reverted some changes from 0.5.0 that caused problems,\n      most notably

  # libmpd-haskell: a client library for MPD

  [![Hackage](https://budueba.com/hackage/libmpd)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vimus/libmpd-haskell.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/vimus/libmpd-haskell)

  ## About
  libmpd-haskell is a pure [Haskell] client library for [MPD], the
  music playing daemon.

  [MPD]: http://www.musicpd.org
  [Haskell]: http://www.haskell.org

  ## Getting
  * [Latest release on Hackage]
  * `git clone git://github.com/vimus/libmpd-haskell.git`

  [Latest release on Hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd "libmpd-haskell on Hackage"

  ## Installation
  With [cabal-install], do

  `cd libmpd-haskell && cabal install`

  [cabal-install]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install

  ## Usage
  With GHCi:

      > :set -XOverloadedStrings
      > import Network.MPD
      > withMPD $ lsInfo ""
      Right [LsDirectory "Tool", LsDirectory "Tom Waits",...]
      > withMPD $ add "Tom Waits/Big Time"
      Right ["Tom Waits/Big Time/01 - 16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought-Six.mp3",...]

  ## MPD API compliance
  Any deviation from the latest version of the [MPD protocol reference]
  is a bug.

  ## Submitting bug reports
  See our [bug tracker]. Test cases are highly appreciated.

  ## Submitting patches
  To submit a patch, use `git format-patch` and email the resulting file(s) to
  one of the developers or upload it to the [bug tracker].

  Alternatively you can create your own fork of the [GitHub repository] and
  send a pull request.

  Well-formatted patches are appreciated. New features should have a test case.
