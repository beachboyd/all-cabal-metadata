synopsis: Jenkins API interface
changelog: ! "0.8.4\n=====\n\n  * Supported http-client >= 0.5\n\n0.8.3\n=====\n\n
  \ * Switched to `Control.Monad.Except`\n\n  * Dropped support for GHC < 7.10\n\n0.8.2\n=====\n\n
  \ * Stopped using the deprecated stuff in `http-client{,-tls}`\n\n0.8.1\n=====\n\n
  \ * Supported GHC 7.10\n\n0.8.0\n=====\n\n  * Dropped `lifted-base` and `lifted-async`
  dependencies\n\n  * Simplified the Jenkins master node configuration record\n\n
  \ * Added `stream` to provide convenient streaming\n\n  * Removed the support for
  disconnects, thus simplifying the public API slightly.\n    Note that `reload`,
  `restart`, and `forceRestart` do not disconnect automatically anymore.\n\n0.7.0\n=====\n\n
  \ * Jenkins' responses to `POST` requests are being read again\n\n  * Added `groovy`
  to ease the communication with the embedded Groovy\n    interpreter (see example/repl.hs)\n\n0.6.0\n=====\n\n
  \ * Made `orElse` more powerful. The old version is available as `orElse_`\n\n  *
  Renamed a bunch of things.  The `Jenkins.Rest` module is intended to be imported
  qualified.\n\n  * Switched to the transformer version of the Church-encoded free
  monad\n\n  * Removed `getS`. As a side-effect, `get` doesn't leak like crazy anymore\n\n
  \ * Generalized `traverseC_` (again)\n\n  * Removed redundant `jenkinsPort` option:
  `jenkinsUrl` handles port numbers well enough\n\n  * Reworked API method construction.
  The new version is safer (it's impossible to forget\n    to specify the format of
  the response), less magical (format is a separate argument to\n    the query function),
  and has fewer corner cases\n\n0.5.0\n=====\n\n  * Replaced `concurrentlys` and `concurrentlys_`
  with `traverseC` and `traverseC_`\n    respectively. Quick migration guide:\n\n
  \   + `concurrentlys`  -> `traverseC  id . toList`\n    + `concurrentlys_` -> `traverseC_
  id . toList`\n\n  * Added `getS` for tighter control of Jenkins responses consumption\n\n
  \ * `post` variants do not read the response body at all anymore\n\n  * Added `orElse`\n\n
  \ * Removed `runJenkinsThrowing` from the API\n\n  * `runJenkins` only catches exceptions
  thrown by the execution of `Jenkins` queries\n\n  * Switched to `network-uri`\n\n
  \ * Removed `io` from the API. Quick migration guide: `io` -> `liftIO`\n\n0.4.3.0\n=======\n\n
  \ * Upgraded dependencies' bounds\n\n0.4.2.0\n=======\n\n  * Generalized `ConnectInfo`\n\n0.4.1.0\n=======\n\n
  \ * Generalized `io`\n\n  * Added `runJenkinsThrowing`\n\n0.4.0.0\n=======\n\n  *
  Switched to `Text` for username and API token (password)\n\n  * Supported `lens-4.0`\n\n0.3.0.0\n=======\n\n
  \ * `restart` does not send requests to `$jenkins_url/restart` anymore. Instead,
  it calls\n  `$jenkins_url/safe-restart` which waits running jobs to complete. New
  `forceRestart` function\n  does now what `restart` did before\n\n  * Massive refactoring\n\n
  \ * More optics in `Network.HTTP.Conduit.Lens`\n\n  * Added `overallLoad` and `computer`
  REST API methods shortcuts\n\n0.2.0.0\n=======\n\n  * Moved onto http-conduit 2.0
  API.\n\n0.1.0.0\n=======\n\n  * Initial release. REST and Discovery APIs support.\n"
