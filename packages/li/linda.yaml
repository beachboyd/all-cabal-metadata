description: ! 'This package (mainly the module LDA) implements the linear discriminant
  analysis.

  It provides both data classification (according to Fisher) and data analysis (by
  discriminant criteria).


  Caused by the usage of the hmatrix package this package needs LAPACK too.

  See INSTALL file for more introductions.'
