description: ! 'This package demonstrates how to program simple interactive 3D

  graphics with OpenGL. It contains two programs, which are both

  about fractals:


  [L-systems] generates graphics from Lindenmayer systems

  (L-systems). It defines a language for L-systems as an embedded

  DSL.


  [Mountains] uses the generalized Brownian motion to generate

  graphics that resemble mountain landscapes.


  The original versions of these programs were written by Matthias

  Reisner as part of a student project at the Brandenburg

  University of Technology at Cottbus, Germany. Wolfgang Jeltsch,

  who supervised this student project, is now maintaining these

  programs.'
