description: ! 'Functions to provide delays, timeouts, and callbacks where the target
  time is calculated either from a period as an offset from the initialization time,
  or at a specific ''UTCTime''.


  Most standard Haskell types are supported for periods, based on the second as the
  base unit quantity. For more complicated period calculations, ''Dimensional''s ''Time''
  type is supported.'
