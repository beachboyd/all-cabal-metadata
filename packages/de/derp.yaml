description: ! 'A parser based on derivatives of parser combinators (Might

  and Darais).  Our paper on Arxiv details the theory of

  parsing with derivatives: <http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5023>.

  This implementation uses my latest work on the theory that

  brings the O(n*|G|^2) complexity bound to O(n) for parsing

  most not-painfully-ambiguous grammars.  (|G| would be the

  size of the initial grammar, n would be size of the input.

  These bounds are based off of observation and intuition;

  they are not proven yet.)  This implementation will not

  terminate if the resulting parse forest is infinite.  We

  know how to extend the implementation to work for infinite

  parse forests with little effort.  If this is something

  you would like to see, send me an email.'
