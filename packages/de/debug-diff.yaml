description: ! '@Debug.Diff@ is a quick tool for comparing two Haskell values, as

  when diagnosing a test failure.  It pretty-prints the values

  (using the @groom@ library) and passes them to an external @diff@

  command (@colordiff@ by default), which writes the diff to standard

  output.


  @Debug.Diff.Config@ provides more control over the diff parameters.'
