description: ! 'This library provides a framework for type-directed composition of
  value

  editors (non-syntactic transformations).  The tools enable \"deep function

  application\" in two senses: deep application of functions and

  application of deep functions.  These tools generalize beyond values and

  functions, via the @DeepArrow@ subclass of the @Arrow@ type class.


  For more information see:


  * The project wiki page <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/DeepArrow>


  * Application of deep arrows for composable interfaces in the TV library:

  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV>


  * The motivating idea and paper "Tangible Functional Programming":

  <http://conal.net/papers/Eros>


  The primary module is "Control.Arrow.DeepArrow".  Examples in

  "Control.Arrow.DeepArrow.Examples".


  /Note/: Many of the type signatures use infix type operators (as in

  @a~>b@).  In reading the documentation and code, be aware that infix

  operators bind more tightly than @->@.
