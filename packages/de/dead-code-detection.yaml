  `dead-code-detection` detects dead code in haskell projects.


  This project is still in an early stage. Currently only those language

  constructs have been implemented that I have stumbled across in projects I used

  it on. If the tool encounters a language construct that it doesn''t understand

  yet, it will crash. (I *think* this is the best behavior since ignoring

  unimplemented language constructs would easily result in false positives and

  false negatives.) If you use `dead-code-detection` on any project and it

  doesn''t work due to a not implemented language construct, please consider

  opening an issue on github.


  ``` shell

  $ dead-code-detection --root Main -isrc
