description: "# depq\n\nDouble-ended priority queues\n\nThis library provides a type
  for 'DEPQ's, along with functions for constructing and querying them. \n\n## Usage\n\nThe
  'Data.DEPQ' module exports the user interface, which is similar to that of most
  Haskell data container libraries.\n\nThe most common use case of this library is
  to populate a DEPQ (either from a 'Foldable' collection or by 'insert'ing incrementally)
  and query either or both of its extremes (with 'findMin', 'findMax', 'popMin', 'popMax',
  'topK', 'bottomK').\n\nHave fun!\n\n## Implementation \n\nCurrently the implementation
  is based on 'IntPSQ' (integer-indexed priority search queues) from the 'psqueues'
  package.\n\n"
