description: ! 'The players of this game will write code (the „genome“) that describes

  how plants (the biological type, not the industrial) will grow. The

  plants will grow simultaneously on the screen (the „garden“), will

  compete for light and will multiply. The players can not change the

  code of a growing plant, but they do have the chance to update their

  code for the next generation -- when a plant drops a seed, it will run

  the newest code. All in all, the game aims to be slowly paced and

  relaxing, something to just watch for a while and something that does

  not need constant attention by the players.


  This package contains the haskell programs, i.e. the game simulation

  with the visual display. It can be used to locally test the plants.'
