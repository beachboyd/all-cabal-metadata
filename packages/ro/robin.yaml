description: ! "# Robin\n\nRobin is a build daemon for Haskell development.\n\n##
  Usage\n\n    robin (start | stop | build | watch | debug)\n\nThis daemon rebuilds
  a cabalized Haskell project whenever a source file\nchanges. It runs one of the
  following commands:\n\n* `./robin.sh`, if that file exists, or\n* `stack build`,
  if `stack.yaml` exists, or\n* `cabal build`, otherwise.\n\n## Commands\n\n* start
  - if the current project doesn't already have a daemon, start one\n* stop - stop
  the daemon for the current project\n* build - show the output of the last build,
  or if a build is in progress, wait\n  for completion and then show its output\n*
  watch - take over the console, always showing the latest build output\n* debug -
  like _start_, but doesn't daemonize\n\nThe default command is _build_.\n\nNote:
  the _current project_ is assumed to be the root of the git working copy\nwhich contains
  the current directory.  definition.\n\n\n## Vim integration\n\n    echo 'setlocal
  makeprg=robin' >> ~/.vim/ftplugin/haskell.vim\n"
