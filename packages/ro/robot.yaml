description: ! "The Haskell Robot\n=================\n\n**Robot** is a library for
  sending fake keyboard and mouse events using\n[Haskell][]. Applications will respond
  as though the user performed the\nactions themselves.\n\n[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/\n\nOnly
  X11 systems are supported right now, but Windows and Mac can be\nadded later if
  anyone cares.\n\nHere are some things you can do:\n\n* Test graphical interfaces
  and websites!\n\n* Play silly pranks on your friends!\n\n* Finally beat those [silly
  Flash games where you press the same button\n  over and over again really fast][blah
  blah blah]. I don't like those.\n\n[blah blah blah]: http://mixermike622.deviantart.com/art/GO-FAST-287788805\n\n\nQuick
  start\n-----------\n\nFirst, download and install the library:\n\n    git clone
  https://github.com/lfairy/robot.git\n    cd robot\n    cabal install\n\nNow try
  running some of the programs in the `examples` directory.\n\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Backends
  for Mac OS X, Windows, and Wayland\n\n* Screenshots\n\n* Actions currently run instantaneously,
  which can be an issue for some\n  applications. Perhaps add a small delay between
  each operation like\n  Java does.\n"
