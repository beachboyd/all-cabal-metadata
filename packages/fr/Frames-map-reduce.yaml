synopsis: Frames wrapper for map-reduce-folds and some extra folds helpers.
changelog: "v 0.2.0.0 \n* Added Combinators for ```record (Maybe :. ElField) rs```
  (Much thanks to Tim Pierson, @o1lo01ol1o, for the idea and the work!).\n* Added
  Combinators polymorphic in record type (```Rec```, ```ARec``` or ```SRec``` are
  supported) and composed interpretation functor ```f :. ElField```\n* ```Maybe :.
  ElField``` case now uses the general case in order to avoid code duplication\n*
  ```Record``` case still uses separate code because the amount of new coercion code
  required was enough to not seem worth the re-use of the polymorphic case.\n\nv 0.1.0.2
  \n* Changed example from \"executable\" to \"test-suite\".  Now it doens't need
  to be built and its dependencies don't leak to library users.\n\nv 0.1.0.1\n* lowered
  containers lower bound\n* rasied some outdated upper bounds (profunctors, hashable)\n\nv
  0.1.0.0\n* Initial hackage release\n"

description: |-
  Frames-map-reduce provides some helpers for using the map-reduce-folds library with vinyl records and Frames.
  These include functions for filtering Frames, splitting records into key columns and data columns and
  recombining key columns with other columns after reducing.
  This package also provides some tools for building folds over records from folds over each column,
  e.g, summing multiple numerical columns into a multi-column result.
