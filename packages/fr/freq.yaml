  ## About

  This is a simple cryptanalytic frequency analysis tool that uses [english character
  digrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) as a probabilistic model for scoring
  ByteStrings according to their randomness (0..1, 0 being the most random, 1 being
  the least random).


  ## Uses

  I currently use this to validate domain names, and so the training data available
  consists of about 6.5 Megabytes of Public Domain 19th and 20th century English novels.
  You can feed any training data you wish to ''freq'' to achieve different results.
