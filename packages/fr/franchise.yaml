description: ! 'Franchise is an easy-to use package for building Haskell

  software.  Unlike Cabal, you aren''t required to track every

  possible dependency in every possible build condition.  In

  addition, you are not required to use an external tool such as

  autoconf in order to configure the build based on which

  packages, libraries and tools are present.

  Note: the cabal dependencies are autogenerated, and approximate.'
