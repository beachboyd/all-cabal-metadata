description: ! 'One can think of an effectful program and its effect

  handler as /two communicating processes/.

  This package provides the missing pieces that let you

  write your programs in such a style in

  @Control.Monad.Freer.Converse@.


  One useful area of application is unit testing. The

  @Control.Monad.Freer.TestControl@ intends to provide what

  you need to write /ad-hoc test fixtures/.'
