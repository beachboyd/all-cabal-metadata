  What is FreeType 2?


  FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is

  designed to be small, efficient, highly

  customizable, and portable while capable of

  producing high-quality output (glyph images). It

  can be used in graphics libraries, display

  servers, font conversion tools, text image

  generation tools, and many other products as

  well.


  The following is a non-exhaustive list of

  features provided by FreeType 2.


  * FreeType 2 provides a simple and easy-to-use

  API to access font content in a uniform way,

  independently of the file format. Additionally,

  some format-specific APIs can be used to access

  special data in the font file.


  * Unlike most comparable libraries, FreeType 2

  supports scalable font formats like TrueType or

  Type 1 natively and can return the outline data

  (and control instructions/hints) to client

  applications.


  By default, FreeType 2 supports the following

  font formats.


  * TrueType fonts (and collections)


  * Type 1 fonts


  * CID-keyed Type 1 fonts


  * CFF fonts


  * OpenType fonts (both TrueType and CFF variants)


  * SFNT-based bitmap fonts


  * X11 PCF fonts


  * Windows FNT fonts


  * BDF fonts (including anti-aliased ones)


  * PFR fonts


  * Type 42 fonts (limited support)


  From a given glyph outline, FreeType 2 is capable

  of producing a high-quality monochrome bitmap, or

  anti-aliased pixmap, using 256 levels of

  ''gray''. This is much better than the 5 levels

  used by Windows 9x\/98\/NT\/2000 or FreeType 1.


  FreeType 2 supports all the character mappings

  defined by the TrueType and OpenType

  specification. It is also capable of

  automatically synthetizing a Unicode charmap from

  Type 1 fonts, which puts an end to the painful

  ''encoding translation'' headache common with this

  format (of course, original encodings are also

  available in the case where you need them).


  The FreeType 2 core API provides simple functions

  to access advanced information like glyph names

  or kerning data.


  FreeType 2 provides information that is often not

  available from other similar font engines, like

  kerning distances, glyph names, vertical metrics,

  etc.


  FreeType 2 provides its own caching subsystem

  since release 2.0.1. It can be used to cache

  either face instances or glyph images

  efficiently.'
