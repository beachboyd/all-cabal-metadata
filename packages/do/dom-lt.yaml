synopsis: The Lengauer-Tarjan graph dominators algorithm.
changelog: "Changes in version 0.2.0\r\n\r\n* Better performance!\r\n* Major bump
  because of strictness changes.\r\n* Functions are now slightly stricter.\r\n  In
  the past the successor list of nodes unreachable from the root wasn't evaluated.\r\n
  \ This is no longer the case and they will be evaluated.\r\n  Moving forward users
  should expect all inputs to be evaluated unless stated otherwise.\r\n* Requires
  GHC >= 8.0 to build (base dependency)\r\n* Requires containers >= 0.5\r\n* Exchanged
  the deprecated container functions with their replacements.\r\n* Replaced a few
  right folds with strict left folds.\r\n* Commented out/removed some unused code.\r\n*
  Replaced mapsnd and swap with variants from base.\r\n* Add very simplistic benchmark/test
  suites."
