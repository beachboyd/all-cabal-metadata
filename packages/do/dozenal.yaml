  =======


  A Haskell library for using Dozenal (Duodecimal - Base 12) numbers.


  ### Usage

  Create number using: (Dozenal String)


  Example: Dozenal "1X"


  Permitted digits: [0..9] ++ "X" ++ "E"


  Dozenal is an instance of the Num class, so you can do numerical computations with
  it.


  Example:


  (Dozenal "10")^2


  (Dozenal "10") + (Dozenal "10")


  ### Limitations

  Internally, the string is converted to decimal and calculations proceed in decimal.
  Once calculations are done, the decimal digit is converted back to dozenal. This
  means that, you may run into an error if the base conversion is not possible. Converting
  from a higher base to a lower base can sometimes not be possible (usually only when
  there are floting point numbers or numbers after the dit - decimal point equivalent
  in dozenal).


  Also, the current implementation uses only integers, and does not support floating
  point numbers.
