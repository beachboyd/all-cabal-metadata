description: |-
  A library to help build command-line programs, both tools and
  longer-running daemons. Its @Program@ type provides unified ouptut &
  logging, command-line option parsing, exception handling, and a place to
  put top-level application state. There's also an underlying @Rope@ text
  type built on a finger tree of UTF-8 fragments along with conveniences
  for pretty printing and colourizing terminal output.

  A description of this package, a list of features, and some background
  to its design is contained in the
  <https://github.com/oprdyn/unbeliever/blob/master/README.markdown README>
  on GitHub.

  Useful starting points in the documentation are
  <../core-program/docs/Core-Program-Execute.html Core.Program.Execute> and
  <../core-text/docs/Core-Text-Rope.html Core.Text.Rope>.

  An ancillary purpose of this library is to facilitate interoperability
  between different package families and ecosystems. Having a single
  batteries-included package (as was originally the case) made using it
  easier, but the resulting dependency footprint was considerable and
  growing. The code is thus now spread across several packages:

  * __core-text__
  * __core-data__
  * __core-program__

  with more forthcoming as we continue to add convenince and
  interoperability wrappers around streaming, webservers, and database
  access patterns.
