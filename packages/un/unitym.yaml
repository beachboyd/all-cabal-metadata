description: ! 'One of the nice things about WAI is that it allows us to combine multiple

  different server frameworks in a single web server- allowing us to use

  (for example) Yesod to develop the server-side rendered HTML part of the

  website, and Servant to develop the REST API part.  But this gives rise

  to a desire to share code between the different frameworks.  This is

  where UnityM comes in.
