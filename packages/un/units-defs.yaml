changelog: |
  Version 2.1.0.1
  ---------------

  * Update .cabal file to export Data.Units.Astronomical.

  Version 2.1
  -----------

  * Add support for Imperial and astronomical units, thanks to @Bebere.

  Version 2.0.1.1
  ---------------

  * Drop 7.8 support, fixing warnings on 8.0.

  Version 2.0.1
  -------------

  * Added the universal gravitational constant, thanks to @hesiod.

  Version 2.0.0.1
  ---------------

  * Typos in documentation. Thanks to Doug Burke for a pull request!

  Version 2.0
  -----------

  * Full re-organization of modules.
  * Addition of US customary units, CGS units, and a few other gubbins.

  Version 1.1
  -----------

  * Added `si` parser.
  * Moved `DefaultUnitOfDim` instances from `SI.MonoTypes` to `SI.Mono`. This allows
    client code to import the monomorphic types without getting these instances. But,
    it may mean that your imports have to change.

  Version 1.0.1
  -------------

   * Added derived SI units.
   * Added British-spelled synonyms for SI units.

  Version 1.0
  -----------

   * First release, contains implementations for SI.
