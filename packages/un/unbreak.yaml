synopsis: Secure and resilient remote file storage utility
changelog: ! "# Change Log\n\n## 0.3.1 - 2015-12-30\n\n- Changed wrong error messages
  and improved existing messages.\n- Added necessary fields to unbreak.cabal.\n- Applied
  [wild](https://github.com/kinoru/wild).\n\n## 0.3.0 - 2015-12-15\n\n- The command
  line arguments interface has changed to multi-mode. Users are now advised to set
  `u` as an alias of `unbreak open`.\n    - `unbreak init`\n    - `unbreak open <FILENAME>`\n
  \   - `unbreak logout`\n    - `unbreak add [OPTIONS] <FILENAME>`\n- Added `unbreak
  add`: Pick a local file, encrypt it, and put it in the remote storage\n- Added `unbreak
  logout`: Explicitly remove the session files from the memory space.\n- Added automatic
  removal of local temporary files in the memory space after `unbreapk open`.\n- Added
  upload error remedy to `unbreak open`: the user's effort won't be immediately lost
  even when the upload fails. Now there is a chance to retry or save it somewhere
  else.\n- Fixed file name encryption: Very silly elemetary cryptographic mistake.
  Eliminated the chance of adversary guessing the file name when there are multiple
  files with the same prefix.\n\n## 0.2.0 - 2015-12-09\n\n- Added encryption of file
  names: File names may be a sensitive information as well. They are now encrypted
  with ChaCha20-Poly1305 and base64url-encoded.\n- Avoid network overhead by checking
  file mtype: The file won't be sent if it hasn't been changed.\n\n## 0.1.0 - 2015-12-05\n\n-
  Prepended a single byte in the encrypted file format to indicate the \"version number.\"
  The byte isn't really used for anything useful yet; it's for forward compatibility.\n"
