description: ! '* /Important note:/ This package will soon be deprecated.

  Use <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-unicode-symbols>

  and\/or

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-unicode-symbols>

  instead.


  This package defines new symbols for a number of functions and

  operators in the base package and for the containers package.


  All symbols are documented with their actual definition and

  information regarding their Unicode code point. They should be

  completely interchangeable with their definitions.


  This package was inspired by unicode-prelude from P&#xE9;ter

  Divi&#xE1;nszky:
