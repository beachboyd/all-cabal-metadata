description: ! "# una: Universal un-archiver\n\nVersion 1.0, by John Wiegley <johnw@newartisans.com>\n\nThis
  is a \"universal\", recursive unarchiver, written because I'm too lazy to\nremember
  all the extraction options for the large number of archive formats I\ndeal with.\n\nOptional
  dependencies:\n\n- StuffIt Expander (free, expander-only version)\n- MacPorts: unarj,
  unrar, lha, p7zip, cabextract\n\n## Usage\n\n    una [OPTION] ARCHIVE...\n\n    If
  no OPTION is specified, the default action is to extract the archive's\n    contents
  into the current directory.\n\n    Options:\n      -h, --help        show help\n
  \     -d, --delete      delete the archive if sucessfully extracted\n      -f, --overwrite
  \  overwrite any existing file\n\nThis script is also smart about unarchiving:\n\n
  \ a) if all the contents of an archive would already extract into a single\n     directory,
  do that;\n\n  b) if the archive contains only one item, extract it into the current\n
  \    directory;\n\n  c) otherwise, if the archive would dump multiple contents into
  the current\n     directory, create a new directory based on the name of the archive,\n
  \    sans extension, and put everything there.\n"
