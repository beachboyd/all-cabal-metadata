description: ! 'SafeHaskell introduced the notion of safe and unsafe modules.

  In order to make as many as possible modules \"safe\",

  the well-known unsafe functions were moved to distinguished modules.

  This makes it hard to write packages that work

  with both old and new versions of GHC.

  This package provides a single module @System.Unsafe@

  that exports the unsafe functions from the base package.

  It provides them in a style ready for qualification,

  that is, you should import them by


  > import qualified System.Unsafe as Unsafe


  The package also contains a script called @rename-unsafe.sh@.

  It replaces all occurrences of the original identifiers

  with the qualified identifiers from this package.

  You still have to adapt the import commands.

  It uses the @darcs-replace-rec@ script from the @darcs-scripts@ package.'
