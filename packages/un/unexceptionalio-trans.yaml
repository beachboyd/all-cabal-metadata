description: |-
  UnexceptionalIO provides a basic type to witness having caught all
  exceptions you can safely handle.  This library builds on that with
  transformers like ExceptT to provide a more ergonomic tool for many
  cases.

  It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.

  > import UnexceptionalIO.Trans (UIO)
  > import qualified UnexceptionalIO.Trans as UIO
