description: ! 'The ''Validation'' type and associated operations.


  This library is intended to be a drop-in replacement for /Data.Valiation/. To shave
  off pointer chasing, it uses -XUnboxedSums to represent the ''Validation'' type
  as two machine words that are contiguous in memory, without loss of expressiveness
  that ''Validation'' provides.


  This library provides pattern synonyms Failure and Success, which allow users to
  pattern match on an Unpacked Validation in a familiar way.


  Functions are also provided for converting an Unpacked Validation to the validation
  library''s These, and vice versa.


  This library is in alpha, and the internals are likely to change.'
