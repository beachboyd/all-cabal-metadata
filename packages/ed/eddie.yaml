description: ! "# What is eddie?\n\nA command line tool for running Haskell functions
  over text files.\n\nIt is also useful for prototyping Haskell text processing functions\nthat
  you will later copy into a program.\n\n# Why is eddie?\n\nThis project actually
  started in response to a code bounty for a\nclojure shell scripting tool. That resulted
  in a specification for the\nrequested program that had all the features of eddie,
  and then\nsome. However, clojure code embedded on the command line looks clumsy,\nso
  the project was shelved.\n\nIn haskell, functional expression are much simpler and
  more\nelegant. In particular, in looking for haskell command line tools, I\nfound
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simple_unix_tools>, which\nconvinced me that
  the original design would be not merely usable, but\nelegant if the expressions
  were done in haskell. Hence, eddie.\n\n# Why not `ghc -e`?\n\nEddie adds features
  to make using it for shell scripting easier:\n\n  *  When given file arguments,
  eddie feeds them to your function.\n  *  Eddie can easily add modules to the namespace
  you use.\n  *  Eddie has options for processing things a line or file at a time.\n
  \ *  Eddie uses either Text or ByteStrings by default, not lists of characters.\n\n#
  More information\n\nThe best place to start is the manual. That's available in the
  source\ntree in both man format in `eddie.1`, and in html in `eddie.html`.\nThe
  latter is also available [online](eddie.html).\n\n# Installation\n\nInstall or build
  with cabal as usual.\n\n# Testing\n\nTesting is done with the haskell shelltestrunner
  package (which can be\ninstalled with cabal). Run `shelltest tests` in the source
  directory\nto run the tests with the currently installed eddie. Use `shelltest\ntests
  -w eddie.hs` to run them using the current source. Use\n`shelltest tests -w dist/build/eddie/eddie`
  to run them with the\ncompiled binary.\n\n# Documentation\n\nThe documenation is
  built with `pandoc` from\n`eddie.md`.  Use the `-s` flag, and convert from\npandoc's
  markdown to your chosen format.\n"
