description: ! 'Edison is a library of purely functional data structures written by

  Chris Okasaki.  It is named after Thomas Alva Edison and for the

  mnemonic value EDiSon (Efficient Data Structures).

  Edison provides several families of abstractions, each with

  multiple implementations.  The main abstractions provided by Edison are:

  Sequences such as stacks, queues, and dequeues;

  Collections such as sets, bags and heaps; and

  Associative Collections such as finite maps and priority queues

  where the priority and element are distinct.'
