  This is a collection of helper functions and some Template Haskell that I use regularly
  and has streamlined my use of the [amazonka][amazonka] framework for interacting
  with [Amazon Web Services][aws]. It was extracted from the code I wrote as part
  of my [AWS via Haskell][aws-via-haskell] series of blog posts.
