description: ! '# AWS Easy


  A simplified, high-level [AWS][aws] API built on top of [amazonka][amazonka]


  This is a collection of helper functions and some Template Haskell that I use regularly
  and has streamlined by use of the [amazonka][amazonka] framework. It was extracted
  from the code I wrote as part of my [AWS via Haskell][aws-via-haskell] series of
  blog posts.
