synopsis: A producer & consumer client library for AWS Kinesis
changelog: ! "### v0.4.0.2\n\nThis release contains (only) breaking changes to the
  Consumer CLI.\n\nWe have switched to using the\n[configuration-tools](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/configuration-tools)\npackage
  for passing options to the CLI. This makes configuration much more\nrobust, and
  adds support for using a YAML-formatted configuration file, as well\nas granularly
  overriding options in a cascading manner (through multiple\nconfiguration files,
  or by passing command line arguments).\n\nSee `example_config.yml` for an example
  configuration file. Run `kinesis-cli\n--help` to see supported command-line arguments.\n\n###
  v0.4.0.1\n\nThis release fixes a bug in the Consumer where a saved state could get\nclobbered
  in case no further records were found at the restored point on a\nshard.\n\n###
  v0.4.0.0\n\nThis release contains breaking changes.\n\n- Replaced the internal use
  of `MonadError` with proper open-world exceptions.\n  The exposed operations which
  may throw exceptions have been adjusted to\n  return `m (Either e a)`; resolves
  [issue\n  \\#17](https://github.com/alephcloud/hs-aws-kinesis-client/issues/17).\n\n-
  [Producer] Implemented a cleaner shutdown routine policy: previously, the\n  producer
  would stay alive indefinitely until the thread on which it was\n  created is killed.
  Now, the producer is shut down immediately once the scope of\n  `withKinesisProducer`
  exits, at which point the queue will be flushed according\n  to a configurable (and
  optional) timeout. Resolves [issue\n  \\#19](https://github.com/alephcloud/hs-aws-kinesis-client/issues/19).\n\n-
  [Producer] Restructured the monolithic error sum types into many smaller\n  types
  to better support the standard mode of use for error handling.\n\n- [Consumer] Removed
  unused `ConsumerError` type.\n\n- [Consumer] Changed batch size to use `Natural`
  type rather than `Int`.\n\n- [Producer] Parameterized the implementation by an arbitrary
  queue structure;\n  by default, the producer's message queue is now implemented
  using `TBMChan`\n  to avoid a bug in `TQueue` which causes live-locking under very
  heavy load.\n\nOther non-breaking changes:\n\n- [Producer] A better, more reliable
  implementation of consuming the input\n  queue in chunks.\n\n- Removed dependencies
  on `either`, `errors`, `hoist-error`, `stm-conduit`;\n  added dependency on `enclosed-exceptions`.\n\n-
  Increased lower bound on `monad-control` to 1.0 (for hygienic purposes).\n\n###
  v0.3.0.2\n\n- Upgrade aws-general, aws-kinesis lower bounds.\n\n### v0.3.0.1\n\n-
  [Producer] Write errors to stderr rather than stdout.\n\n- [Consumer CLI] Exit with
  a failure code (1) when the run is not considered\n  successful (i.e.  if a limit
  was specified, and the CLI failed to retrieve\n  that many records).\n\n### v0.3.0.0\n\nAll
  changes were in the Producer client.\n\n- Do not retry messages indefinitely; add
  support for a configurable retry\n  policy.\n\n- Reject messages synchronously which
  exceed the Kinesis record size limit.\n\n### v0.2.0.3\n\nAll changes were in the
  Consumer CLI.\n\n- Add a --timeout option, which will cause the consumer CLI terminate
  after a\n  specified number of seconds.\n\n- Change the behavior of --save-state
  to only save the state when a run of the\n  consumer CLI was successful (i.e. either
  no limit was specified, or the\n  precise number of items requested was indeed retrieved
  within the alotted time).\n\n\n### v0.2.0.2\n\n- Upgrade to newer versions of `aws-general`
  and `aws-kinesis` which support the\n  security token header (necessary for using
  credentials from EC2 instance\n  metadata). The --use-instance-metadata option should
  now work properly.\n\n- When --restore-state is passed with a non-existent file,
  it will be ignored;\n  if it is passed with a malformed file, an error will be thrown;
  the old\n  behavior was to throw an error in either case.\n\n### v0.2.0.1\n\nAll
  changes were in the Consumer CLI.\n\n- Add switch to get credentials from EC2 instance
  metadata,\n  --use-instance-metadata\n\n- Make --limit optional to consume indefinitely\n\n-
  Allow custom region with --region\n\n- If the CLI is terminated for any reason,
  before shutting down it will record\n  its state if --save-state is passed\n\n\n###
  v0.2.0.0\n\n- [Consumer] Add the ability to save & restore stream state (i.e. last
  consumed\n  sequence number per shard).\n\n- [Consumer CLI] Add --save-state, --restore-state
  options\n\n### v0.1.0.2\n\n- Support specifying AWS keys as options to the CLI (either
  directly or from a\n  file). You must specify one of these options.\n\n- Remove
  filtering & date range capabilities from the CLI; remove `--raw` option,\n  which
  will now be the only behavior.\n\n- Fix CLI to print unescaped strings.\n\n### v0.1.0.1\n\n-
  Add some throttling to the consumer loop to avoid rate limiting\n- Relax the lower-bound
  on `monad-control`\n- Upgrade to `lens-4.7`, add `lens-action` dependency\n\n###
