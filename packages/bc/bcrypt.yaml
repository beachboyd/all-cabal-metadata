description: ! 'Haskell bindings to the bcrypt password hash.


  Unlike other bindings already in existence, this package is designed to allow users
  to work directly with password hash strings that include information about the hashing
  algorithm, strength, and salt. This approach allows hashed passwords to be stored
  in a single field that can also be used by non-Haskell applications, and makes it
  easy to implement a policy of updating passwords hashed to an old policy next time
  the plaintext password is available.


  Version 1.1.3 of the OpenWall C source for bcrypt is included in this package (<http://www.openwall.com/crypt/>).
  The only modification is that the flag which enables the use of assembler has been
  disabled.

  Announcements about hs-bcrypt (including security announcements) will be sent to
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hs-bcrypt-announce/join - if you use this
  library please consider subscribing. This mailing list is moderated and is expected
  to have a very low volume of mail traffic.'
