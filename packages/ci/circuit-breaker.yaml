  # circuit-breaker
  Circuit breakers are an error handling machine inspired by the circuit breakers used in electrical systems. Just
  like their namesake, software circuit breakers prevent pushing traffic through a failing component
  until it has recovered.

  As of the current version, all `CircuitBreaker`s use a "leaky bucket" approach to backoffs.
  In the definition of a circuit breaker, the first `Natural` argument is the number of milliseconds that need to pass before an error is expunged.
  Coupled with an error threshold argument, this provides a surprising amount of flexibility for cirucit breakers in the wild, although you'll want to monitor and tune them over time.

  ### Using a circuit breaker
  The following short example illustrates how to define a circuit breaker & use it.

  ```haskell
  testBreaker :: CircuitBreaker "Test" 1000 4
  testBreaker = undefined

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      -- Initializes the empty storage for all circuit breakers
      cbConf <- initialBreakerState
      -- Perform a bunch of "work". Because we have a 50% failure rate and trigger the breaker after four
      -- errors, this will cause the breaker to disable additional calls.
      forM_ [1..30] $ const . noteError . flip runReaderT cbConf $ withBreaker testBreaker computation

      -- simulating a backoff long enough to decrement the accumulated errors.
      threadDelay 5000000

      noteError . flip runReaderT cbConf $ withBreaker testBreaker computation
      where
          noteError action = print =<< catchAny action (const $ pure (Left Failed))



  -- | This computation fails 50% of the time
  computation :: ReaderT CircuitBreakerConf IO Int
  computation = do
      shouldFail <- liftIO randomIO
      when shouldFail $ error "Failed"
      pure 42
  ```

  The first thing to notice is that the `CircuitBreaker` definition exists entirely at the type level.
  This guarantees that the definition of a particular `CircuitBreaker` can't somehow change at runtime.

  All calls to `withBreaker` require a `CircuitBreakerConf` to be present in a reader environment.
  `initialBreakerState` simply initializes an empty `CircuitBreakerConf` to save you the trouble of creating one yourself.
