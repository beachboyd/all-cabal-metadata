synopsis: Optimised list functions for doing index-related things
changelog: ! '# 0.3.1.0


  * Added `ireplicateM` and `ireplicateM_`.


  # 0.3.0.0


  * `ifind` now returns the index alongside with the value (same as in `lens`).


  # 0.2.0.0


  * `izipWithM` and `izipWithM_` have been generalised from `Monad` to `Applicative`
  (which mimics what was done in base-4.9).


  # 0.1.0.0


  First release.

description: Optimised list functions for doing index-related things. They're faster
  than common idioms in all cases, they avoid <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/12620
  space leaks>, and sometimes they fuse better as well.
