description: ! "# ats-pkg\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/atspkg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/atspkg)\n\nThis
  is a build system for ATS written in Haskell and configured with Dhall. It\nis not
  yet stable.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install is via a script, viz.\n\n```bash\ncurl
  -sSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/bash/install.sh | bash
  -s\n```\n\nAlternately, you can download\n[Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html)
  and\n[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html) and install with\n\n```bash\ncabal
  new-install ats-pkg ~/.local/bin --happy-options='-gcsa' --alex-options='-g'\n```\n\nNote
  that `$HOME/.local/bin` will need to be on your `PATH`.\n\n## Examples\n\n`atspkg`
  is configured with\n[Dhall](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall/docs/Dhall-Tutorial.html).
  You\nmay wish to read the Dhall tutorial first, but you do not need to fully\nunderstand
  everything to get started.\n\n### Project Templates\n\nYou can use [pi](https://github.com/vmchale/project-init)
  with the builtin `ats`\ntemplate as follows:\n\n```\npi new ats cool-project\n```\n\nYou
  can then build with `atspkg build` or install with `atspkg install`.\n\nAlternately,
  you can start with a templated Haskell library calling ATS code:\n\n```\npi git
  vmchale/haskell-ats ambitious-project\n```\n\nwhich can be built with `atspkg build`
  followed by `cabal new-build`.\n\n### Building a Binary Package\n\nThe minimal configuration
  for a package with a binary target is as follows:\n\n```dhall\nlet pkg = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/pkgs/default.dhall\nin\nlet
  dbin = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/pkgs/default-bin.dhall\n\nin
  pkg //\n  { bin =\n    [ dbin //\n      { src = \"src/program.dats\"\n      , target
  = \"target/program\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\nYou need only specify the source
  file and the target; `atspkg` will parse your\nATS source files and track them (it
  will not track included C).\n\n### Depending on a Library\n\nLibrary specifications
  are also written in Dhall. Let's look at an example:\n\n```dhall\nlet dep =\n  {
  libName = \"atscntrb-concurrency-0.1.0\"\n  , dir = \".atspkg/contrib\"\n  , url
  = \"https://github.com/vmchale/ats-concurrency/archive/0.1.0.tar.gz\"\n  , libVersion
  = [0,1,0]\n  }\n\nin dep\n```\n\nThis defines a dependency by pointing to its tarball.
  Let's look at a simple\nexample:\n\n```\nlet pkg = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/pkgs/default.dhall\n\nin
  pkg //\n  { bin =\n    [\n      { src = \"src/compat.dats\"\n      , target = \"target/poly\"\n
  \     , libs = ([] : List Text)\n      , gc = True\n      }\n    ]\n  , dependencies
  = [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/ats-concurrency/master/atspkg.dhall
  ]\n  }\n```\n\nAs Dhall is distributed, you can simply point to the package configuration
  URL\nto add a dependency. You can find several preconfigured packages\n[here](https://github.com/vmchale/atspkg/tree/master/pkgs),
  or you can write\nyour own configurations. You can even make package lists that
  are later filtered\nif you so choose.\n\n### Building a Haskell Library\n\nYou can
  see an example [here](https://github.com/vmchale/fast-arithmetic). You\ncan configure
  the ATS side of things as follows:\n\n```\nlet pkg = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/pkgs/default.dhall\n\nin
  pkg //\n  { atsSource = [ \"ats-src/ambitious-project.dats\" ] }\n```\n\nThis just
  tells `atspkg` to look for a source file called\n`ats-src/ambitious-project.dats`,
  which will be compiled to\n`ambitious-project.c` in the default directory (i.e.
  `cbits`). You can then\ncall the generated code just as you would call C.\n\nYou
  may want to consider\n[ats-setup](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ats-setup)
  as well if you are\npackaging the Haskell for distribution.\n\n### Calling Haskell
  from ATS\n\nYou can see a demo [here](https://github.com/vmchale/fast-arithmetic).\nCurrently,
  there is not generic `Storable` instance for ATS, so the process is\na bit more
  involved than is ideal. `atspkg` has abilities similar to\n[hs2ats](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs2ats),
  which means that you can\nusually generate ATS types based on the Haskell types.\n\nThe
  following is a minimal example of a configuration file:\n\n```dhall\nlet pkg = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/pkgs/default.dhall\nin\nlet
  dbin = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmchale/atspkg/master/pkgs/default-bin.dhall\n\nin
  pkg //\n  { bin =\n    [\n      dbin //\n      { src = \"src/project.dats\"\n      ,
  target = \"target/project\"\n      , hsDeps = [ { cabalFile = \"hs/foreign.cabal\",
  objectFile = \"hs/Foreign.o\" } ]\n      , hs2ats = [ { hs = \"hs/Foreign.hs\",
  ats = \".atspkg/hs2ats/gen.sats\" } ]\n      }\n    ]\n    , ccompiler = \"ghc-8.2.2\"\n
  \   , cflags = [\"-package-db\", \"hs/dist-newstyle/packagedb/ghc-8.2.2/\", \"-optc-O2\",
  \"-optc-flto\", \"-optc-mtune=native\", \"hs/Foreign\"]\n  }\n```\n"
