synopsis: A safe approach to CAS and other atomic ops in Haskell.
changelog: ! "## 0.8.1.1 [2017.12.10]\n* Bundle `testing/Fetch.hs` with the package
  tarball\n\n## 0.8.1\n* Simplify `Setup.hs` to support `Cabal-2.0`/GHC 8.2\n* Properly
  link `store_load_barrier` and friends against the GHC RTS on Windows\n  when using
  GHC 8.2 or later\n\n## 0.8.0.4\n* Internal changes to support forthcoming GHC 8.0\n\n##
  0.8\n* Implements additional fetch primops available in GHC 7.10\n\n## 0.7\n* This
  release adds support for GHC 7.10 and its expanded library of (now inline) primops.\n\n##
  0.6.1\n* This is a good version to use for GHC 7.8.3.  It includes portability and
  bug fixes\n  and adds atomicModifyIORefCAS.\n\n## 0.6.0.5\n* fix for GHC 7.8\n\n##
  0.6.0.1\n* minor ghc 7.8 fix\n\n## 0.6\n* add atomicModifyIORefCAS, and bump due
  to prev bugfixes\n\n## 0.5.0.2\n* IMPORTANT BUGFIXES - don't use earlier versions.
  \ They have been marked deprecated.\n\n## 0.5\n* Nix Data.Atomics.Counter.Foreign
  and the bits-atomic dependency.\n\n## 0.4.1\n* Add advance support for GHC 7.8\n\n##
  0.4\n* Further internal changes, duplicate 'cas' routine well as barriers.\n* Add
  `fetchAddByteArrayInt`\n* Add an `Unboxed` counter variant that uses movable \"ByteArray\"s
  on the GHC heap.\n\n## 0.3\n* Major internal change.  Duplicate the barrier code
  from the GHC RTS and thus\n  enable support for executables that are NOT built with
  '-threaded'.\n\n## 0.2.2.1\n* Minor, add warning.\n\n## 0.2.2\n* Add more counters\n\n##
  0.2\n* Critical bugfix and add Counter.\n\n## 0.1.0.2\n* disable profiling\n\n##
  0.1.0.0\n* initial release\n"

description: ! 'After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it''s

  difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly

  unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method

  based on the concept of "Tickets".


  Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to

  add access to other variants that may be of

  interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.


  Note that as of GHC 7.8, the relevant primops have been included in GHC itself.

  This library is engineered to work pre- and post-GHC-7.8, while exposing the

  same interface.'
