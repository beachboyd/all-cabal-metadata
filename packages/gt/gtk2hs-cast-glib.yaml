description: ! 'This package contains a type class called Cast with a function cast,
  that is a

  wrapper for all the castTo* functions of gtk2hs.  It makes it easier to write

  other functions that require a castTo* as a parameter, like xmlGetWidget from

  glade.  The main utility of these packages is to use xmlGetWidgetCast, a

  version of xmlGetWidget defined in gtk2hs-cast-glade, which has the type:

  xmlGetWidgetCast :: (Cast widget, WidgetClass widget) => GladeXML -> String ->

  IO widget.


  This is the glib package of gtk2hs-cast, which contains the definition of the

  Cast class.'
