  ===============


  gtk-sni-tray provides a [StatusNotifiedHost](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/StatusNotifierHost/)
  widget written using the gtk+3 bindings for haskell provided by [gi-gtk](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk).
  It also provides a simple standalone executable, `gtk-sni-tray-standalone`, that
  is configured with command line arguments. This executable will run the aforementioned
  widget by itself in a strut window, on each monitor for each it is requested.


  taffybar

  ----------

  It is generally recommeneded that you use this widget with [taffybar](https://github.com/travitch/taffybar),
  which will allow you to combine it with other useful widgets, and will give more
  flexibility in configuration.


  StatusNotifierWatcher

  --------------------------

  By default, it is assumed that you are running an isolated StatusNotifierWatcher
  daemon. [status-notifier-item](https://github.com/IvanMalison/status-notifier-item)
  provides a StatusNotifierWatcher executable that you can use for this purpose. If
  you get an error like


  ```

  MethodError {methodErrorName = ErrorName "org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown",
  methodErrorSerial = Serial 7, methodErrorSender = Just (BusName "org.freedesktop.DBus"),
  methodErrorDestination = Just (BusName ":1.549"), methodErrorBody = [Variant "The
  name org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher was not provided by any .service files"]}

  ```


  when you start `gtk-sni-tray-standalone` it is probably because you have not started
  a StatusNotifierWatcher on your system. You can solve this problem by passing the
  `--watcher` flag to `gtk-sni-tray-standalone`, but this is not recommeneded, because
  many SNI processes do not monitor for new watcher processes, and so may not immediately
  register when this new watcher is started.
