description: ! 'Contains several implementations of data structures implementing a
  /single-in, single-out/ paradigm,

  and implements monad transformers for their safe use.  The monad transformer part
  of the library

  includes tools to fully encapsulate single-threaded use of a priority queue in a
  monad, including an

  array-based heap implementation.

  In general, the purely functional queue types can be ordered in increasing order
  of speed on generic insertion/deletion operations

  as follows: ''Stack'', ''Queue'', ''PQueue'', ''IntQueue'', ''SkewQueue'', ''FQueue'',
  ''Heap''.

  (''PQueue'', ''IntQueue'', and ''SkewQueue'' are all very nearly the same speed.)

  Work is in progress on a van Emde Boas

  or y-fast priority queue implementation, which provides sublogarithmic functionality
  for all operations.
