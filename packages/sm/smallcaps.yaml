description: ! 'smallcaps is a pre-processor library for LaTeX files.

  The library comes with an executable that makes most

  functionality accessible through a command line interface.

  The pre-processor formats sequences of uppercase letters

  with TeX''s @\\small@ macro or whatever you configure.

  Uppercase letters at the beginning of sentences are not

  formatted. Other formatting conditions can be configured by

  the user.


  The executable can be configured through its command line

  arguments as well as through TeX comments. In the default

  configuration, lesscase does not change the content of any

  macro argument or environment (different from document).

  More and less restrictive configuration profiles can be

  activated and adapted. Configurations can be stored and

  restored at any time, even while processing the input

  file.


  ["Text.SmallCaps"]

  exports the main program as library.


  ["Text.SmallCaps.Config"]

  specifies the default configuration values for

  "Text.SmallCaps".


  ["Text.SmallCaps.TeXParser"]

  parses ''Text'' to a ''TeXElement'' token stream.


  ["Text.SmallCaps.TeXLaTeXParser"]

  parses a ''TeXElement'' token stream and produces a

  ''LaTeXElement'' token stream.


  ["Text.SmallCaps.DocumentParser"]

  replaces uppercase letters in ''LaTeXElement'' token

  streams.


  A simple program can be defined as


  @

  import Data.Default           ( def )

  import Text.SmallCaps         ( smallcaps )

  import Text.SmallCaps.Config  ( defaultProfile )

  main = smallcaps def defaultProfile

  @


  This is virtually all the code that is necessary to

  implement the executable @lesscase@. Have a look in the

  source of the executable @twocase@ which only formats

  sequences of two or more uppercase letters. It is a good

  reference for understanding the API changes that took

  place between the revisions 0.5 and 0.6.'
