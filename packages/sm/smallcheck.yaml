  Changes
  =======

  Version 1.1.5
  -------------

  * Add `limit :: Monad m => Int -> Series m a -> Series m a`
  * Add `genericSeries` and `genericCoseries`, so that you can use the generic
    implementations more flexibly. Previously, the generic implementation was
    only avaialable as the default method for `series`/`coseries` but not as
    standalone functions.

  Version 1.1.4
  -------------

  * Add instances for fixed-width Int and Word types (Int8, Word8 etc.)

  Version 1.1.3.1
  ---------------

  * Fix compatibility with GHC 7.8 and older

  Version 1.1.3
  -------------

  * Add `Serial` and `CoSerial` instances for `Word` and `Natural`

  Version 1.1.2
  -------------

  * Export the `test` function
  * Add a `listSeries` function

  Version 1.1.1
  -------------

  Export some auxiliary functions from `T.S.Series`, and document how to express
  `consN` and `altsN` for `N > 4`.

  Version 1.1.0.1
  ---------------

  Documentation fixes

  Version 1.1
  -----------

  * Add a `Serial` instance for `Ratio`
  * Add the `NonEmpty` wrapper for lists
  * Add `listM` (the monadic version of `list`)
  * Add optional explanation for test outcomes

  Version 1.0.4
  -------------

  Fix compatibility with GHC 7.4.1

  Version 1.0.3
  -------------

  Fix a bug where no test cases were generated for some functional types (#19).

  Version 1.0.2
  -------------

  Fix a bug in the generic instance

  Version 1.0.1
  -------------

  Make SmallCheck build with GHC 7.4

  Version 1.0
  -----------

  This is a major incompatible release of SmallCheck. Virtually every function has
  changed its name, type, semantics or module. So please carefully read the docs
  when upgrading.

  For some highlights, see [this blog post](http://ro-che.info/articles/2013-02-19-smallcheck.html).

  Version 0.6.2
  -----------
  * Derive Typeable Property instance
  * Add smallCheckPure

  Version 0.6.1
  -----------

  * Documentation improvements
  * Make the package build with GHC 7.4.1

  Version 0.6
  -----------

  * Default Generic implementation of Serial instance (by Bas van Dijk)
  * The code is split into modules
  * Convert much of README into haddock documentation
  * Many small API changes
  * Remove impure Testable (IO a) instance

  Version 0.5
  -----------

  Make the package build with GHC 7.2. Some cosmetic changes.

  Version 0.4
  -----------

  The module SmallCheck is now Test.SmallCheck.  Packaged with Cabal.

  Version 0.3
  -----------

  Existential quantifiers now have unique variants for which two witnesses
  are reported when uniqueness fails.  The over-generating coseries method
  for functions of functional arguments has been replaced; now 'coseries'
  and the 'alts<N>' family take a series argument. Test counters are
  now Integers, not Ints.  Ord and Eq are now derived for the N types.
  Examples extended.

  Version 0.2
  -----------

  The 'smallCheck' driver now takes an argument d and runs test series
  at depths 0..d without interaction, stopping if any test fails.
  The interactive variant is still available as 'smallCheckI'.  All
  Prelude numeric types now have Serial instances, including floating-point
  types. Serial types Nat and Natural are also defined.  Examples extended.

  Version 0.1
  -----------

  The differences from 0.0 are two fixes (space-fault, output buffering),
  an 'unsafe' but sometimes useful Testable (IO a) instance and additional
  examples.

description: "SmallCheck: a property-based testing library for Haskell\n========================================================\n\nSmallCheck
  is a testing library that allows to verify properties for all test\ncases up to
  some depth. The test cases are generated automatically by\nSmallCheck.\n\nUsefulness
  of such an approach to testing is based on the following observation:\n\n> If a
  program fails to meet its specification in some cases, it almost always\n> fails
  in some simple case.\n\nTo get started with SmallCheck:\n\n* Read the [documentation][haddock]\n*
  If you have experience with QuickCheck, [read the comparison of QuickCheck and SmallCheck][comparison]\n*
  Install it and give it a try!  \n  `cabal update; cabal install smallcheck`\n* Read
  the [paper][paper] or [other materials][oldpage] from the original\n  authors of
  SmallCheck (note that that information might be somewhat outdated)\n* If you see
  something that can be improved, please [submit an issue][issues]\n* Check out [the
  source code][github] at GitHub\n\n[haddock]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/smallcheck/latest/doc/html/Test-SmallCheck.html\n[hackage]:
