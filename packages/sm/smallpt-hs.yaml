  ==========


  This is a port of [smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), a global

  illumination path tracer written in 99 lines of C++. The port is written in

  99 lines of Haskell.


  There are two major differences: performance and argument parsing. The Haskell

  code compiled with GHC 6.12.1 is about 4.5 times slower than the C++ version.

  (I only tested on my anemic Atom N450-powered netbook...) The C++ code takes an

  optional argument, which should be a integer greater than 4.


  Give it a spin

  --------------


  This repository contains more than the 99 lines smallpt-hs.hs file. There are

  other variants with a criterion wrapper to benchmark the code. The cbits

  directory contains the original smallpt.cpp file modified to be expose the main

  entry point as a C symbol callable from Haskell via FFI.


  Every attempt so far use the vector package. The 99 lines file is derived from

  Smallpt/Mutable.hs. The Storable code doesn''t improve the performance and is

  less convenient to use. The Unboxed code lose in performance because the Vec

  type can''t benefit from an explicit unpack pragma.


  If you can make the code faster or easier to read, please let me know!
