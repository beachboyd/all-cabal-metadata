  Shake is a tool for writing build systems - an alternative to make, Scons, Ant etc.
  Shake has been used commercially for over five years, running thousands of builds
  per day. The website for Shake users is at [shakebuild.com](http://shakebuild.com).


  #### Documentation


  * **Why use Shake?** Shake lets you write large robust build systems, which deal
  properly with generated source files and run quickly. If you are writing a custom
  build system of any moderate size (more than a few rules) you should use Shake.
  The advantages over other build systems are detailed in the document [Why choose
  Shake?](http://shakebuild.com/why).

  * **How do I use Shake?** Shake is a Haskell library that you use to define your
  rules. The [Shake manual](http://shakebuild.com/manual) provides a walk through
  of a small but realistic example, assuming no Haskell knowledge.

  * [Generated documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/shake/latest/doc/html/Development-Shake.html)
  for all functions, includes lots of examples.

  * [Blog posts](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/shake) detailing
  ongoing development work.

  * [Academic paper](http://ndmitchell.com/downloads/paper-shake_before_building-10_sep_2012.pdf)
  on the underlying principles behind Shake.


  #### Other links


  * [Download the Haskell package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake) from
  Hackage and install it using Cabal.

  * [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/shake-build-system)
  for any questions/bugs/thoughts on Shake. If you need more information and aren''t
  sure where to start, use the mailing list.

  * [Questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shake-build-system) can
  be asked on StackOverflow with the tag `shake-build-system`.


  Is your company using Shake? Write something public (even just a [tweet to `@ndm_haskell`](https://twitter.com/ndm_haskell))
  and I''ll include a link [on the website](http://shakebuild.com/#who-uses-shake).
