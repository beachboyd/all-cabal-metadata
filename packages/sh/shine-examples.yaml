  # shine-examples

  Examples for the `shine` library.

  ## Compiling

  You need [ghcjs](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs)

  A great way of building ghcjs packages is to use the
  [reflex platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform)

  ## Contents

  ### animated-shapes

  A lot of different shapes, some of them changing color, size and other properties with time.

  Note: it will not work without manually copying `image.png` next to the `index.html` file.
  See the "handling assets" section in the shine README for more info.

  ### simple-interaction

  An extremely simple user interaction: a black square appears on left mouse down and disappears on mouse up.

  ### mountaincar

  This is a human-controlled version of the [Mountain car problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_car_problem) (a standard testing domain in Reinforcement learning). Use the left/right keys to control the car.

  ### spaceinvaders

  This is a simplified version of the [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) video game. Use the left/right keys to move the laser cannon and the space key to fire (or to restart the game).
