synopsis: Link shortcuts for use in text markup
changelog: ! '# 0.4.2.1


  * Fixed links to GHC extensions.


  # 0.4.2.0


  * Added `useShortcutFrom`.

  * `@` is now allowed in Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket nicks.


  # 0.4.1.0


  * Exported `useShortcut` (gee).


  # 0.4.0.0


  * Exported `Shortcut`.

  * Renamed “braumeister” to “brew” (it still uses Braumeister, but this can change
  in the future).


  # 0.3.0.0


  * Added shortcut names to their descriptions.


  # 0.2.0.0


  * Descriptions of shortcuts look much better now.

  * “sublime” was renamed to “sublimepc”, since it''s possible that some other package
  manager for Sublime Text would emerge in the future.

  * Shortcut “tvt” for TV Tropes was removed – it''s just “tvtropes” now.

  * “facebook” can link to profiles by their ID.

  * “tvtropes” properly capitalises names of categories (if given as an option) –
  previously you needed to write e.g. “SugarWiki”, now “sugar wiki” works too.


  # 0.1.0.0


  First release.

  It''s intended to be used in wikis and text markup converters (such as Pandoc) and
  anywhere else where humans may be entering links.
