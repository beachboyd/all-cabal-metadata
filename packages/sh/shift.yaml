  # Teleport

  A fork of [teleport](https://github.com/bollu/teleport) with a focus on clean,
  functional code.

  ## Use

  Unfortunately, since we can't change the directory of the user (possibly an
  upstream bug), we have to wrap `teleport-hask` in a bash script, so put
  `bash/teleport` on your `PATH` somewhere.

  I also put the following in my `~/.bashrc` so that `teleport` would run in the
  correct shell:

  ```bash
  alias go="source $HOME/.local/bin/teleport"
  ```
