description: ! 'A very simple interface for processing data in ESRI

  shapefile format.  Includes functions for reading or

  writing whole .shp and .shx files, as well as for

  generating .shx index files from .shp data files.

  Also includes an interface to read individual records

  on-demand from shapefiles, useful for very large databases.'
