  [https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/ihaskell-hvega/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/ihaskell-hvega/CHANGELOG.md).


  ## 0.1.0.3


  The only change is to the cabal file, where `cabal-version: >=1.10` has

  been changed to `cabal-version: 1.18`. I honestly don''t know what the

  minimum-supported version actually is (the version bump is to match

  that used by `hvega`.


  ## 0.1.0.2


  Updated the upper bounds of `aeson` to really allow v1.4. This was not

  released on Hackage.


  ## 0.1.0.1


  The source code has been moved to the `src` sub-directory to match the

  layout used by `hvega`.


  Several incorrect links in the cabal file have been fixed (as my GitHub

  user name is not actually `githubuser`).


  The cabal package now includes `stack.yaml` and `default.nix` (although

  the latter is *not* guaranteed to be correct), as well as a

  change log.


  Since `ihaskell` is now in Stackage, the LTS version has been updated

  to reflect this (to LTS 11.19), and the extra dependency removed.


  ## 0.1.0.0


  This is the initial version of `ihaskell-hvega`, and is released with

  `hvega` version 0.1.0.0.

  View [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations

  created by the `hvega` package in IHaskell notebooks. It relies on

  [Vega-Embed](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html) to

  do the hard work of parsing and displaying the Vega Lite specification.
