description: ! 'WARNING: THIS PACKAGE IS EVIL. DO NOT USE IT!


  It is common when defining a monad transformer to define instances for that

  transformer for each class in the @mtl@ library, to allow easy composition

  with the existing standard monad transformers. However, doing this is very

  tedious, and actually unnecessary, given that most of these instances across

  different transformers are identical, and can actually be expressed purely

  in terms of @MonadTrans@, or @MonadTransControl@ (from the @monad-control@

  package) for the more complicated classes.


  The reason this is not generally done is because it requires the

  @OverlappingInstances@ extension, which is generally considered evil.

  However, it does actually work. If you define a monad transformer, and

  instances for @MonadTrans@ and @MonadTransControl@, and import

  "Control.Monad.Instances.Overlapping", your monad transformer will magically

  have sensible instances for all the @mtl@ type classes. And if you don''t

  like one of the instances provided, you can always define your own instance,

  which will override the \"default\" one provided by this package, because by

  the rules for @OverlappingInstances@, your instance is more \"specific\"

  than the one exported by "Control.Monad.Instances.Overlapping".


  The main disadvantage of this is that errors in code using

  @OverlappingInstances@ can result in some really strange error messages that

  are not very helpful. The reason this is evil is because this places an

  additional burden (of dealing with confusing error messages) not just on

  those who use this package directly, but anybody who indirectly uses any

  code that, somewhere down the line, imported

  "Control.Monad.Instances.Overlapping", due to the \"viral\" nature of

  instances. Also, if another person were to make a package very similar to

  this one, and somebody ended up importing both code that used this package,

  and code that used the other package, than neither of them would work

  anymore. This is the problem with orphan instances.


  If you absolutely insist on using this code, you should probably define

  manual instances for the @mtl@ classes the hard way as well, to avoid this

  kind of breakage (thus defeating the purpose of this package). Of course,

  realistically, this package is for everyone who wishes to ignore all such

  advice and do bad things anyway (including myself). This is my gift to you!'
