description: ! '

  Fast TagSoup parser. Speeds of 20-200MB/sec were observed.


  Works only with strict bytestrings.


  This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the original @tagsoup@ package:


  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup hiding (parseTags, renderTags)

  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup.Fast


  Besides speed @fast-tagsoup@ correctly handles HTML @\<script\>@ and @\<style\>@
  tags, converts tags to lower case and can decode non UTF-8 XML for you.


  This parser is used in production in BazQux Reader feeds and comments crawler.'
