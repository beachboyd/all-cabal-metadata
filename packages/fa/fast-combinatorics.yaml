description: ! "# fast-combinatorics\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/fast-combinatorics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/fast-combinatorics)\n\nThis
  is a library for fast combinatorics using ATS. As such, make sure\na C compiler
  is installed. Build reports from Windows users are always welcome.\n\nCurrently
  it is in-progress, being somewhat constrained by the fact that I have\nyet to figure
  out how to share arbitrary-precision types between ATS and Haskell.\n\n## Building\n\nThe
  Haskell library comes with the C bundled, however you may wish to build from\nsource
  if you are hacking on the library. To that end, you can install\n[stack](http://haskellstack.org/),
  [patscc](http://www.ats-lang.org/Downloads.html), and\n[pats-filter](https://github.com/Hibou57/PostiATS-Utilities)
  and build with\n\n```bash\n $ ./shake.hs\n```\n\nYou will also likely want to install\n[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html)
  as well as\n[cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/).\n\n## Documentation\n\n###
  Using the ATS library\n\nOne of the nice things about a Haskell wrapper is that
  some of Haskell's\ntooling/libraries may be used. In particular, you may like to
  interact with the\nlibrary via a REPL, viz.\n\n```bash\n $ cabal new-repl\n```\n\n###
  Using the Haskell library\n\nYou may wish to read the ATS source code for an indication
  of what sorts of\nthings ATS allows us to prove things about our programs, such
  as proofs of\ntermination.\n\nThere are also a few caveats: note that all results
  and arguments\nmust be of the `Int` type. This unfortunate constraint will hopefully
  be fixed\nin the future, but right now it limits the usefulness of the library.\n"
