description: ! "# fast-combinatorics\n\nThis is a library for fast combinatorics using
  ATS. You may need to download the \nrelevant ATS libraries\n[here](http://www.ats-lang.org/Downloads.html#Install_of_ATS2_include)
  if\nlinking fails.\n\nCurrently it is in-progress, being somewhat constrained by
  the fact that I have\nyet to figure out how to share arbitrary-precision types between
  ATS and Haskell.\n\n# Building\n\nThe Haskell library comes with the C bundled,
  however you may wish to build from\nsource if you are hacking on the library. To
  that end, you can install\n[stack](http://haskellstack.org/), [patscc](http://www.ats-lang.org/Downloads.html)
  , and\n[pats-filter](https://github.com/Hibou57/PostiATS-Utilities) and build with\n\n```bash\n
  $ ./shake.hs\n```\n"
