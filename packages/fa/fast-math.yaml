description: ! 'The "Numeric.FastMath" module brings into scope many unsafe @RULES@
  for

  ''Float''s and ''Double''s that can greatly improve run time performance.

  It is roughly equivalent to gcc\''s @-ffast-math@ compiler flag.

  Optimisation (at least @-O1@) must be enabled for any @RULES@ to take effect.


  These rules are unsafe because they don''t strictly adhere to the

  IEEE-754 regulations and may subtly change the results of your numeric computations.

  See the <http://github.com/liyang/fast-math/ README> on github for more details.'
