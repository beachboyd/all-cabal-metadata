  The factor package
  =================

  The [factor package][] is a [Haskell][] library for factoring positive
  integers into prime powers.

  This software is released under the [MIT License][].

  Install
  -------

  Installing the factor package requires [cabal][]:

      git clone https://github.com/gilith/factor.git
      cd factor
      cabal install --enable-tests

  Test
  ----

  Use [cabal][] to run the test suite:

      cabal test

  Run
  ----

  The factor package contains an executable called factor, which is run
  as follows:

      Usage: factor N
      where N is the positive integer to be factored
