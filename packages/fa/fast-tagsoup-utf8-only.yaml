description: ! '

  Fast TagSoup parser. Speeds of 20-200MB/sec were observed.


  Works only with strict bytestrings.


  This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the original @tagsoup@ package:


  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup hiding (parseTags, renderTags)

  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup.Fast.Utf8Only


  Besides speed @fast-tagsoup@ correctly handles HTML @\<script\>@ and @\<style\>@
  tags and converts tags to lower case.

  This fork purposefully removes support for parsing non-utf8 documents, to avoid
  dependency on text-icu.

  If you need to handle other encodings, refer to the original <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fast-tagsoup>


  This parser is used in production in BazQux Reader feeds and comments crawler.'
