changelog: ! "2015-02-19 - version 0.2.0.0\n============================\n\nThis version
  brings breaking changes if you typically\nuse a non-default set of linting arguments.\n\n-
  Command line arguments -w/--wordlength, -d/--distance and -t/--type\n  have been
  removed.\n\n- The -m/--matchlength replaces -w/--wordlength\n\n- The-w/--words,
  -l/--lines, and -p/--percent take Int/Int/Double, respectively.\n  The parameter
  itself represents the type of lint you wish to perform, while the\n  argument provided
  by the user indicates the maximum distance between matches.\n\n- Intersecting lints
  have been added. The type/distance arguments provided (or not)\n  are used to create
  a set of lists. The intersection of these lists\n  is provided as the end result.\n\n-
  Some granularity in the human-readable data has been lost. Due to the addition of\n
  \ intersecting lints, all final results are treated as Doubles, and the \"intervening\n
  \ distance\" between word pairs are unlabeled. This is no issue if running one type
  of\n  lint, but with more, it is difficult to sort out which unit is being provided.
  \n\n- Wordlint.hs has been heavily manicured.\n\n- Wordlint.Linters and the `Linter`
  datatype and associated functions have been\n  taken the place of the `run*Linter`
  family of functions in Wordlint.hs\n\n- Wordlint.Output has been added to house
  the Human/Machine functions from Wordlint.hs.\n  These functions have been pruned
  and some higher-level functions added.\n\n2014-12-01 - version 0.1.0.2\n============================\n\n-
  Changed \"-s vim\" to \"-s error\".\n\n- Changed output of \"-s error\" to produce
  better, text editor-agnostic output.\n\n2014-11-25 - version 0.1.0.1 \n=============================\n\n-
  Added labels to machine-readable output table.\n\n\n"

description: ! 'Wordlint locates matching pairs of words repeated within a user-defined

  distance.  Text may be linted by distance between words (that is, by word

  count), by line count, and/or by percentage of the total words in the file.

  For details on running the program, see README or the included man page.

  Internally, Wordlint separates a text file (or stdin) into

  a list of "Words", after processing user flags. An instance of the "Word"

  datatype consisting of a String that contains a lemma; its line and column

  coordinates; and its "position": an Int or Float depending on the type of check

  invoked by the user.

  This list is first filtered by the user-defined minimum

  length of the lemma. Next, items are matched by their lemma and exclusive

  coordinates before being added to a list of "Wordpairs", a data structure

  containing two Words and the difference between their respective "positions".

  If multiple types are specified, all Int positions are converted to the Double

  type and the resulting lists are intersected to produce the final results.

  Finally, these Wordpairs are optionally filtered by the difference in their

  positions (another user-specified option). All remaining Wordpairs are

  processed for printing to stdout in machine-readable (default) or

  human-readable format. Plugins exist for integration with Vim

  (https:\/\/github.com\/gbgar\/Wordlint.vim) and Emacs

  (https:\/\/github.com\/gbgar\/wordlint.el).'
