synopsis: A library for word-wrapping
changelog: ! "\n0.4.1\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed a bug that caused breakTokens
  to diverge for lines with\n   indentation longer than the indentation width when\n
  \  preserveIndentation was enabled. (Thanks Callum Oakley.) The\n   resulting fix
  does the following:\n   * When breakLongWords is enabled, this change reduces the
  indentation\n     of the indented lines to result in lines that are no longer than\n
  \    the wrap limit, so they will have reduced indentation and word\n     fragments.
  This is a trade-off with other options that are open to\n     evaluation.\n   *
  When breakLongWords is disabled, this change reduces the\n     indentation of the
  indented lines and leaves whole words, unbroken,\n     on them, resulting in lines
  that are longer than the indentation\n     limit. This behavior is similar to non-indented
  lines with\n     over-long tokens. This is also a trade-off with other options that\n
  \    are open to evaluation.\n\n0.4\n===\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed a bug where each
  line was being wrapped after every word\n   because only one case in breakTokens
  was reached (thanks Callum\n   Oakley)\n\nPackage changes:\n * Added a simple benchmark
  suite\n\n0.3.3\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed accidental breaking of long tokens
  when they could be wrapped\n   instead.\n\n0.3.2\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed
  a bug that prevented wrapping sometimes.\n\n0.3.1\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fix inconsistent
  long token breaking (long tokens anywhere but the\n   beginning of a line)\n\n0.3\n===\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added the breakLongWords setting to WrapSettings. This setting makes\n
  \  it possible to cause words to get broken up over multiple lines if\n   their
  lengths exceed the wrapping width.\n\n0.2\n===\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added a WrapSettings
  data type for controlling wrapping behavior.\n * All functions now require a WrapSettings.\n
  * Added defaultWrapSettings for prior behavior.\n * Wrap settings now include a
  setting to control how indentation is\n   preserved in broken lines.\n\nBug fixes:\n
  * Lines with only whitespace are preserved as empty lines.\n\n0.1.2\n=====\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Fixed a bug where multiple consecutive newlines were not properly preserved\n
  \  as advertised (#2)\n\n0.1.1\n=====\n\nPackage changes:\n * Removed a duplicate
  mention of the changelog file in the cabal\n   package description that used the
  wrong filename case (#1)\n\n0.1\n===\n\n* First version.\n"
