description: ! 'This utility is useful for finding out if some old,

  misplaced version of a file (say from your old laptop)

  has any new text in it that never got checked in, synced,

  or copied over to your newest version of the file.

  The basic unix diff tool is sometimes incredibly

  unsatisfactory for this purpose, for example when text has

  been moved around, or when there are widespread whitespace

  differences.'
