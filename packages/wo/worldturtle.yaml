changelog: "# Changelog for turtle-haskell\r\n\r\n## v0.2.0\r\n\r\n* Split `TurtleCommand`
  into `TurtleCommand` and `WorldCommand` to help reduce\r\n  boilerplate of having
  to apply a turtle to a command for every stage of a\r\n  command block.\r\n* Added
  `runWorld`, `runTurtle`, `run`, and `(>/>)` functions.\r\n* `circle` command split
  into `arc` and `circle` commands.\r\n* Fixed `shiftHue` as function did not match
  documentation.\r\n\r\n## v0.1.2\r\n\r\n* Added the `branch` function.\r\n\r\n##
  v0.1.1\r\n\r\n* Added `sleep` function.\r\n* Added `rotationSpeed` function.\r\n*
  Added the `shiftHue` color function.\r\n* Fixed bugs in circle rendering when going
  in a clockwise direction.\r\n* Fixed the bounds and potential recursion pitfall
  in internal normalization\r\n  functions.\r\n* If rotation left 270 degrees will
  not turn right 90 degrees and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## v0.1.0\r\n\r\nInitial release.\r\n"

  Have you ever heard of [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)?

  If not, then think of a @turtle@ as a cursor you can program to draw!

  Turtle graphics are a fantastic introduction to the world of
  programming and to the syntax of a new programming language.

  ![parallelcircles gif](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/worldturtle-0.2.0.0/docs/docs/images/parallel_circles_animated_300.gif)

  This module is a framework built on top
  of [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) to render turtles
  programmed in Haskell as animations. This is primarily aimed as a
  teaching tool to beginners - but also, it's cool to draw things!

  See The API ref, "Graphics.WorldTurtle", for features!
