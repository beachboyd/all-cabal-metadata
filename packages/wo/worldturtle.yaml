  Have you ever heard of [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki//Turtle_graphics)?

  No? Think of a @turtle@ as a cursor you can program to draw graphics!

  Turtle graphics are a fantastic introduction to the world of
  programming and to the syntax of a new programming language.

  ![parallelcircles gif](docs/images/parallel_circles_animated_300.gif)

  This module is a framework built on top of "Graphics.Gloss" to render turtles
  programmed in Haskell as animations. This is primarily aimed as a
  teaching tool to beginners - but also, it's cool to draw things!

  See The API ref, "Graphics.WorldTurtle", for features!
