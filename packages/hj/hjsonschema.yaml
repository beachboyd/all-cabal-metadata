synopsis: JSON Schema library
changelog: ! "# 1.8.0\n\n+ Add GHC 8.4 support (thanks @4e6 !).\n+ Drop GHC 7.10 support.\n+
  Fix JSON Pointer resolution error.\n\n# 1.8.0\n\n+ Allow HTTPS references (thanks
  @creichert!).\n+ Use `safe-exceptions` to eliminate the risk of catching asynchronous
  exceptions.\n\n# 1.7.2\n\n+ Remove upper bounds.\n\n# 1.7.1\n\n+ Bump http-types.\n\n#
  1.7.0\n\n+ Test with GHC 8.2. Drop GHC 7.8.\n+ Rework `allUniqueValues` related
  utility functions.\n\n# 1.6.3\n\n+ Bump hjsonpointer and QuickCheck.\n\n# 1.6.2\n\n+
  Bump aeson.\n\n# 1.6.1\n\n+ Fix Haddocks.\n\n# 1.6.0\n\n+ Fix defect where validators
  alongside \"$ref\" weren't ignored.\n\n+ Fix defect where local references would
  fail if an \"id\" key had set resolution scope to start from a different document.\n\n+
  Vendor latest tests.\n\n+ Remove `ReferencedSchemas`.\n\n+ Create `Scope` to hold
  information that changes during validation.\n\n+ Use a sum type for \"type\" values.
  Thanks to Philip Weaver (GitHub @pheaver).\n\n# 1.5.0.1\n\n+ Raise test dep upper
  bounds.\n\n# 1.5.0.0\n\n+ Report details of `\"required\"` validator failure.\n+
  Bump `directory`.\n\n# 1.4.0.0\n\n+ Rename `Data.JsonSchema.*` modules to `JSONSchema.*`.\n+
  Rename `Data.Validator.*` modules to `JSONSchema.Validator.*`.\n\n# 1.3.0.1\n\n+
  Bump `vector`.\n\n# 1.3.0.0\n\n+ Rewrite failure messages.\n\nWe used to return
  a list of every failed validator, no matter how far it was buried within subschemas
  of the original schema.\n\nNow we return a tree of failure messages, so that if
  the first schema had only three validators, then no more than three top level failures
  will be returned.\n\n+ Move the code to parse each validator from JSON from `Data.Validator.Draft4`
  into the validators' modules themselves.\n\n+ Switch from Prelude to Protolude.\n\n+
  Switch `Data.JsonSchema.Fetch` from lazy to strict bytestrings.\n\n# 1.2.0.2\n\n+
  Bump hspec.\n\n# 1.2.0.1\n\n+ Switch to hspec for tests.\n\n# 1.2.0.0\n\n+ Return
  `AdditionalPropertiesObject` error correctly (was mistakenly returning `AdditionalItemsObject`
  instead.\n+ Don't silence errors resulting from subschemas of \"anyOf\" or \"oneOf\".\n\n#
  1.1.0.1\n\n+ Bump `aeson` and `hjsonpointer`.\n\n# 1.1.0.0\n\n+ Rename `schemaForSchemas`
  to `metaSchema` and `schemaForSchemasBytes` to `metaSchemaBytes`.\n\n# 1.0.0.0\n\n##
  Bug fixes:\n\n+ Fix JSON Pointer bug. Pointers were being built in reverse order
  and so were totally invalid.\n+ Use `.:!` instead of `.:?` to parse the draft 4
  schema. The only way to omit optional fields in JSON Schema Draft 4 is to omit them
  entirely, `\"null\"` can't be used for this.\n\n## API Changes:\n\n+ Add referenced
  schema loop detection.\n+ Add a new `referencesValidity` function.\n+ `checkSchema`
  now checks referenced schema's validity in addition to the starting schema's validity.
  This change bubbles up to the one-step validation functions as well.\n+ Switch most
  of the fetching code to use `URISchemaMap` instead of `ReferencedSchemas`. It didn't
  need to know about the more complicated data type.\n+ Rething failure related names.
  Change `Invalid` to `Failure`, add a new `Invalid` type alias which is only used
  for final results.\n+ Failures now include the failing part of the data as well
  as a JSON Pointer to it, so you don't have to worry about resolving the pointer.\n\n##
  Fundamental Changes:\n\n+ Make `Fail` (previously `Failure`) an instance of `Functor`.\n+
  Add a `Validator` data type which is an instance of `Profunctor`.\n+ Add a `Spec`
  data type for collections of `Validators`.\n\n## General:\n\n+ Switch from 2 to
  4 space indentation.\n+ Update the vendored JSON Schema Test Suite.\n\n# 0.10.0.3\n\n+
  Bump http-client.\n\n# 0.10.0.2\n\n+ Enable GHC 8.\n\n# 0.10.0.1\n\n+ Fix .cabal
  file.\n\n# 0.10\n\n+ Rewrite fetching internals.\n+ Fix reference resolution defects,
  add more tests.\n+ Switch to a Perl style regex library, which is closer to ECMAScript
  regexes than the previous Posix style one.\n+ Add one-step validation functions
  ('fetchFilesystemAndValidate' and 'fetchHTTPAndValidate').\n+ Alias the validation
  failure type exported by 'Data.JsonSchema.Draft4' to\n'Invalid', change its field
  names.\n\n# 0.9\n\n+ Partial rewrite. The API of the library has changed, see the
  examples\nfolder for how to use the new one.\n\n+ Users of the library can now write
  schemas in Haskell as well as JSON.\n\n# 0.8\n\n+ Improve scope updating and resolving.\n+
  Rename RawSchema's _rsObject field to _rsData.\n+ Make RawSchema's _rsURI field
  a Maybe. This way schemas without a starting URI can say so explicitly with Nothing
  instead of with \"\".\n+ Rename Graph to SchemaGraph. Declare it with data instead
  of type. Give it a field referencing the starting schema. This field is used to
  find the curent schema if no URI is in scope and a self-referencing $ref is found
  (e.g. \"#\").\n+ Change the order of the last two arguments to fetchReferencedSchemas.\n\n#
  0.7.1\n\n+ Support GHC 7.8 again.\n\n# 0.7\n\nChange error type from Text to ValidationFailure.\n\nRevert
  the 0.6 changes to validate. Also switch from Vector to list. Validate is now:\n
  \ Schema err -> Value -> [ValidationFailure err]\n\nAdd fetchReferencedSchemas',
  which lets the user provide their own MonadIO function to be used when fetching
  schemas. This lets them do things like only fetch schemas from particular domains.\n\n#
  0.6\n\nBreak the API so the library doesn't induce boolean blindness.\n\nChange
  validate\n  was: Schema -> Value -> Vector ValErr\n  now: Schema -> Value -> Either
  (Vector ValErr) Value\n\nChange Schema\n  was: type Schema = Vector Validator\n
  \ now: newtype Schema = Schema { _unSchema :: [Validator] }\n\n# 0.5.3\n\n+ Switch
  from http-conduit to http-client.\n\n# 0.5.2\n\n+ Add convenience function for validating
  and compiling draft 4 schemas simultaneously.\n\n# 0.5.1\n\n+ Switch from wreq to
  http-conduit; drop lens dependency.\n\n# 0.5\n\n+ Start changelog.\n+ Rename Utils.hs
  to Helpers.hs.\n+ Move all non-ValidatorGen functions in Validators.hs to Helpers.hs.\n+
  Various touchups.\n"

description: ! '# DEPRECATION NOTICE


  `hjsonschema` was an attempt to build a very modular JSON Schema library. Validators
  have [a concrete type](src/JSONSchema/Validator/Types.hs) and can be mixed and matched
  into new [Specs](src/JSONSchema/Types.hs).


  However this flexibility came at the price of complicating the code. I don''t think
  it was the right tradeoff, especially since situations where you''d want to change
  what validators make up a `Spec` at runtime seem rare.


  Also, there are many parts of JSON Schema that `hjsonschema` doesn''t implement
  properly (as you can see from the issue tracker). I''m hoping that a new JSON Schema
  library will come along that handles these correctly. In the meantime I''m happy
  to merge working fixes into here.
