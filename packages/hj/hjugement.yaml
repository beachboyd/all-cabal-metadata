description: ! "# Majority Judgment\n\n## Common language\n\nThe Majority Judgment
  asks us to answer to a specific, operationally pertinent,\nquestion about several
  choices, by judging each choice in an absolute way\n(i.e. such that the removal
  or addition of choices\ndoes not change our evaluation of the other choices)\nby
  giving them a grade (or level) on a common scale.\n\nThis common scale contains
  as many grades as our supposed common expertise\nis able to distinguish, in order
  to faithfully represent\nthe properties of the attribute it tries to measure.\nHence,
  a common scale should be crafted for each different attribute.\nThe inter-subjective
  meaning of each grade\nbeing reinforced by the practice of judgments.\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples
  of common scales could be:\n- [“No”, “No, but”, “Yes, but”, “Yes”] for adhesion,\n-
  [“None”, “Not Enough”, “Enough”, “Much”, “Too Much”] for quantity,\n- [“To Do”,
  “Prioritized”, “Blocking”, “Urgent”, “Too Urgent”] for priority,\n- [“Useless”,
  “Interesting”, “Useful”, “Indispensable”, “Enslaving”] for utility,\n- [“To Reject”,
  “Insufficient”, “Acceptable”, “Good”, “Very Good”, “Too Good”] for quality.\n\n##
  Judging one choice\n\nFor each choice taken separately,\neach grade of the scale
  is associated to the number\nof individual judgments which have given this grade
  to this choice.\n(eg. for 5 judges: [“Insufficient”, “Acceptable”, “Acceptable”,
  “Good”, “Good”])\nThis forms a dilated scale where each grade is expanded (resp.
  shrunk)\nwhen more (resp. less) supported than the others.\nLike this, the only
  grade which is defended by an absolute majority\nbegining from one side of the scale,\nwithout
  being rejected by an absolute majority\nbeginning from the other side of the scale,\nis
  the one which spans over the middlemost\nof this dilated scale (here: “Acceptable”).\nThis
  is the most consensual majority grade for this choice.\n\nIf the number of individual
  judgments is small and even\n(eg. for 6 judges: [“Insufficient”, “Acceptable”, “Acceptable”,
  “Good”, “Good”, “Good”]),\nthere is however a probability that two different grades\nborder
  the middlemost of this dilated scale (here: “Acceptable” and “Good”).\nBut only
  the lower grade (here: “Acceptable”) rewards consensus,\nand thus is considered
  to be the most consensual.\nIndeed, if any other choice obtains less scattered judgments\n(eg.
  [“Acceptable”, “Acceptable”, “Acceptable”, “Acceptable”, “Good”, “Good”])\nall enclosed
  into these two grades,\nit will obtain a most consensual majoritary grade\ngreater
  or egal (here: “Acceptable”) to the one of this choice.\nWhich would not necessarily
  be the case with the greater grade (here: “Good”).\n\n## Ranking many choices\n\nTo
  sort many choices means being able to compare them two-by-two,\nwhich is done according
  to their most consensual majority grade.\nIn case of equality, the minimum individual
  judgments of this grade\nare removed from both dilated scales so that one of them
  has no longer any,\nthen the comparison goes on with the new most consensual majority
  grades.\nLike this, either a choice is judged higher than the other,\nby the geatest
  number of judgments which differenciate them according\nto a most consensual majoritary
  grade,\nor both choices precisely have the same distribution of individual judgments.\n\nOne
  can see that the farest an individual judgment is\nfrom the most consensual majoritary
  grade,\nthe less impact it has on the result.\nThis rewards honest individual judgments,\nby
  ignoring as near as may be the most cranky or strategic judgements.\n\n## Properties\n\nThe
  Majority Judgment is:\n\n- allowing anonymity:\n  interchanging the names of judges
  does not change the outcome:\n  all judges are given an equal power.\n\n- neutral:\n
  \ interchanging the names of choices does not change the outcome:\n  all choices
  are treated equally.\n\n- complete:\n  every choice is either superior or inferior\n
  \ to any other choice, or both when equal.\n  Hence the Majority Judgement is not
  subject\n  to Condorcet's paradox.\n\n- monotone:\n  if a choice is superior or
  egal to another one,\n  and a judge increases its grade for it,\n  it becomes strictly
  superior.\n\n- transitive:\n  if a first choice is superior to a second one,\n  and
  this second one is superior to a third,\n  then the first is superior to the third).\n\n-
  coherent:\n  it is independent of irrelevant alternatives as formulated by Nash-Chernoff:\n
  \ removal or addition of choices does not change\n  the judges’ evaluations of the
  other choices.\n  Hence the Majority Judgement is not subject\n  to Arrow's paradox.\n\n-
  strategy-proof-in-grading:\n  judging a choice higher or lower\n  than our intimate
  judgement has the opposite impact\n  on its most consensual majority grade.\n\n-
  partially strategy-proof-in-ranking:\n  increasing (resp. decreasing) the rank of
  a choice with respect to another choice,\n  can not decrease (resp. increase) the
  rank of this other choice.\n\n- not Condorcet-consistent:\n  not guarantying the
  selection of a choice\n  which is preferred by a majority against every of the others
  separately.\n  \n  Except when the electorate is “polarized”:\n  when the higher
  (resp. the lower) a judge evaluates one choice the lower (resp. the higher)\n  she/he
  evaluates the other, so there can be no consensus;\n  hence when judges are most
  tempted to manipulate.\n  \n  This property is judged undesirable, by Michel Balinski
  and Rida Laraki,\n  as they prove how easily the Majority Rule can go wrong when
  voting\n  on but two candidates, let alone more.\n\n- not excluding the no-show
  paradox:\n  it may be better for a judge not to judge\n  than to express her/his
  opinion sincerely because her/his vote\n  can tip the scales against his favorite
  choice.\n  \n  This property is judged insignificant, by Michel Balinski and Rida
  Laraki,\n  when compared with the serious problems of methods of election,\n  the
  Arrow and Condorcet paradoxes and strategic manipulation.\n  Moreover, the only
  methods based on measuring that exclude\n  the no-show paradox are point-summing
  methods,\n  which, amongst other drawbacks, are highly manipulable.\n\n## Resources\n-
