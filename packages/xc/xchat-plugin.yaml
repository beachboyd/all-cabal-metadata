synopsis: XChat
changelog: ! "CHANGES\n0.0.2 -> 0.0.3\n - Network.IRC.XChat.Example moved to\n   Network.IRC.XChat.Examples.AutoOp\n
  - New example added : a simple counter\n - Plugin memory doesn't require to be Storable
  anymore\n - Less internal malloc/free\n - The memory type MUST now be defined in
  the programmer's module\n - Le type version a été enlevé\n0.0.1 -> 0.0.2\n - imports
  have been cleaned\n - corrected bug with the StripRules type\n   (no-attribute and
  no-color had to be swapped)\n - now every allocated memory should be freed\n   (it
  wasn't the case yet, as the previous version\n    was the first one, and I just
  wanted some working\n    stuff)\n - added some strictness annotations, but I guess
  many\n   more should be added although it shouldn't make\n   a real difference (it
  is just a binding after all)\n0.0.1\n - first release\n - not available on Hackage
  (and won't be)\n====================\nPlans for later versions\n\n- more examples\n-
  consider removing the \"XChatPlugin a\" argument of all functions,\n  since at first
  glance, one and only one plugin handle is defined\n  in each plugin\n- replace event
  strings with an event type, for type safety and\n  to avoid mistyping an event string.
  Furthermore, it improves\n  the documentation to be able to get an exhaustive list
  of possible\n  command; with strings we are never sure there is a forgotten one.\n"

description: ! "This package adds bindings to the plugins system of XChat to Haskell.\n\nOnly
  2.8.8 version of XChat is supported.\nIt builds some programe called hsxchat you
  can use to build\nyour plugins.\n\nIt is developped on a GNU/LINUX system,\n so
  don't expect it to work under Windows\n (although it should be quite easy to port).\n\nIt
  is yet experimental, only the example given in\n the examples (AutoOp and CountDown)
  are known to work.\n\nI think all other features should also work,\n but there may
  be memory leaks, or performance issues.\n\nIf you have patches to repair some bug
  or improve the design\n as well as some test files, I will be glad to have them\n
  (se?drikov@gm?ail.com without the question marks),\n but please don't send feature
  request or complains,\n since the code is not yet mature.\n\nWelcomed tests files
  are:\n plugins which should compile but don't\n plugins which leaks memory but shouldn't\n
  plugins which results in a segfault\n plugins which behave correctly (for regression
  tests)\n\nIf your test is split in many files,\n please send a single archive file
  (for example a *.tgz)\n\nYet I didn't even spent time to add strictness annotations\n
  or to hunt memory leaks due to my lack of relevant examples.\n"
