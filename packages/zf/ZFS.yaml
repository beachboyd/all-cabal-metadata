description: ! "This is a Cabalized and somewhat modernized/cleaned-up package containing
  Oleg's famous ZipperFS. For details, see <http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1036>.\n\nA
  demonstration of how to use it is contained in zfs.pdf. The short of the matter
  is:\n\n       \"Load ZFS.hs into GHCi\n       Start up the system: main at the GHCi
  prompt\n       From some terminal: 'telnet localhost 1503'\"\n\nAnd then you can
  play around with it.\n\nThis package also comes with an old implementation of delimited
  continuations. Ideally it would be updated to use the maintained package, CC-Delcont
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/CC-delcont>. But I don't
  know how.\n"
