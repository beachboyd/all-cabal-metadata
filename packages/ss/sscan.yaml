  # sscan -- Sean's scanner

  ## Synopsis

  sscan is a UI for scanning multi-page documents using the scanimage(1)
  command and a flatbed scanner.

  I wrote sscan because I often need to scan multi-page documents on my
  GNU/Linux system, and I have only a flatbed scanner, without an ADF.

  sscan was originally a crude Python script.  Now it is a somewhat more
  robust Haskell program, relying on the [Brick][] library.

  ## Installation

  1. Ensure that your scanner has [SANE support][].
  2. Install prerequisite utilities:
  ````
  apt-get install ocrmypdf pdftk sane-utils haskell-stack imagemagick
  ````
  3. Use [stack][] to build and install sscan:
  ````
  stack install sscan
  ````

  Note that stack will automatically download and install the various
  Haskell dependencies of sscan -- unfortunately, these are not yet
  likely to all be installable from your distribution's mirrors.

  [SANE support]: http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html
  [stack]: https://haskellstack.org/

  ## Configuration

  sscan does not yet have a configuration file.  If it did, this could
  be used to configure the available presets, the default settings on
  startup, and the output directory.  Patches welcome.

  ## Usage

  Ensure that `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH environment variable.

  Then open a terminal, run `sscan` and follow the on-screen
  instructions.  If you can't see all the key bindings, you will need to
  increase the size of your terminal.

  ## Bugs/patches

  By e-mail to `<spwhitton@spwhitton.name>`.
