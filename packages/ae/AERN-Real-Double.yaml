description: ! 'This package provides bindings and tests for using machine Double

  values as endpoints for the interval arithmetic defined in packages AERN-Basics
  and

  AERN-Real.


  Most users of this package will only need to import one end-user API module.

  There is a choice of three such modules, each providing a different

  level of abstraction for the type of intervals with Double endpoints:


  * "Numeric.AERN.DoubleBasis.RealApprox" gives RealApprox - an abstract data type

  limited to operations that interpret each interval strictly as an

  approximation to a single real number.  As an instance of Fractional,

  the numerical operations safely overapproximate

  the exact real operations by rounding the intervals outwards.


  * "Numeric.AERN.DoubleBasis.RealIntervalApprox" gives RealIntervalApprox - an abstract

  data type limited to operations that interpret each interval strictly as an

  approximation to a /set/ of real numbers.  All RealApprox operations are

  available also for RealIntervalApprox.  Additionally, one can create approximations
  that

  certainly cover two given approximations and one can perform all

  operations rounding /inwards/ to allow safe semi-deciding of set inclusions.

  As a consequence of inner rounding, anti-consistent intervals such as [1,0] may
  arise

  and are treated using Kaucher arithmetic.


  * "Numeric.AERN.DoubleBasis.Interval" gives full access to the interval type,

  including the Double endpoints.


  The accompanying modules "Numeric.AERN.DoubleBasis.MRealApprox", "Numeric.AERN.DoubleBasis.MRealIntervalApprox"

  and "Numeric.AERN.DoubleBasis.MInterval" add in-place versions of most of the pure
  operations

  provided by the respective above module.


  For further information, please refer to the documentation of these six modules

  and the sample programs in the demo folder.


  This package does not compile with ghc 7.0.* due to a

  compiler bug that has been fixed for the 7.2.1 release.
