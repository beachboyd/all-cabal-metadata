description: ! 'Type classes abstracting typical approximate real number arithmetic
  operations

  including rounded

  field operations and common elementary operations.

  Two kinds of rounding are supported: rounding up/down in the numerical order

  or rounding in/out in a refinement order.


  A concrete implementation of refinement order rounded operations

  is given for intervals in the package AERN-Real-Interval.

  Concrete implementations of up/down rounded operations is

  given in AERN-Real-Double for ordinary Double

  fixed-precision numbers.  These can serve as interval

  endpoints.  In a future release also MPFR arbitrary-precision numbers

  will be made available as interval endpoints.


  This package does not compile with ghc 7.0.* due to a

  compiler bug that has been fixed for the 7.2.1 release.

  Haddock documentation can be found via <http://code.google.com/p/aern/wiki/Main>.'
