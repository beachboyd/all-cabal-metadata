description: ! 'Type-classes abstracting various kinds of approximations for exact
  entities:


  * those that are /near/ to the exact value due to limited granularity

  (eg floating point numbers with fixed granularity (aka precision)

  approximating real numbers or bounded-degree polynomials with floating point coefficients

  approximating continuous functions)


  * those that somehow /enclose/ the exact entity, usually using a pair of /endpoints/


  Type classes are provided to capture:


  * the partial, sometimes semi-decided, natural ordering (<=) used in relation to
  /nearness/


  * the partial, sometimes semi-decided, refinement ordering (&#8849;) used in relation
  to /enclosure/


  This package does not compile with ghc 7.0.* due to a

  compiler bug that has been fixed for the 7.2.1 release.
