  # Changelog

  ## 1.0.3.0 - 2019-11-03

  ### Fixed

    - Encode empty lists as "[]" rather than "\n -"

  ## 1.0.2.0 - 2019-10-15

  ### Changed

    - Only quote YAML 1.2 boolean strings "true" and "false" (upper or
      lowercase), not "on", "off", "yes", "y", "no", "n" (if you want to quote
      these strings, use `encodeQuoted`).

  ## 1.0.1.0 - 2019-10-15

  ### Added

    - `encodeQuoted`: Encodes with all keys/strings quoted
    - `encodeQuotedDocuments`: Encodes documents with all keys/strings quoted

  ### Changed

    - Simple strings (scalars) are now written unquoted.

    - Multi-line strings (with trailing newlines) are now written as literal
      block scalars.

  # aeson-yaml

  BSD3-licensed, pure Haskell library to encode any Aeson value as YAML.

  ## Usage

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.Aeson.Yaml as Aeson.Yaml

  Aeson.Yaml.encode :: ToJSON a => a -> LazyByteString

  -- To encode multiple values, separated by '---' (YAML documents),
  -- use `encodeDocuments`.
  Aeson.Yaml.encodeDocuments :: ToJSON a => [a] -> LazyByteString

  -- To encode values of different types, use `toJSON` from `Data.Aeson`
  -- like so:
  encodeDocuments [toJSON x, toJSON y, toJSON z]
  ```

  See [bin/JsonToYaml.hs](bin/JsonToYaml.hs) for a simple command-line application
  using this library.

  ## Documentation

  [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-yaml)

  ## License

  [BSD3](LICENSE)

  ## Motivation

  This library does not depend on any external YAML library with C bindings,
  like `yaml`, or a restrictive license, like `HsYaml` (GPLv3). Note, though,
  that this library can only be used for encoding, not decoding.

  This library also works with GHCJS and Eta.
