changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-examples\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-10-30\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-11-06\n\n*
  First version revised A. Changed the dependency boundaries so that the package uses
  the latest versions.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2020-11-06\n\n* First version revised B. Fixed
  some issues with the text preprocessing so that avoid unconsistency between different
  packages. Some simplification of the code for the\npropertiesTextG executable.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2020-11-07\n\n* Second version. Added the possibilities to use new related
  to generated with r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package duration
  metrices.\nChanged the dependencies boundaries for this.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-11-09\n\n*
  Third version. Added the possibility to use coefficients' version of the rhythmicity-related
  functions from the phonetic-languages-rhythmicity and\nphonetic-languages-properties
  packages.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-11-09\n\n* Third version revised A. Fixed issue
  with the wrong output option for one of the columns in the propertiesTextG executable
  running output.\n\n## 0.3.1.1 -- 2020-11-09\n\n* Third version revised A. Fixed
  the wrong comment about the first command line argument.\n\n## 0.3.2.0 -- 2020-11-10\n\n*
  Third version revised B. Fixed issue with missing variant for procBothF function
  in the working program. Updated the dependency boundaries of\nthe ukrainian-phonetics-basic.\n\n##
  0.3.3.0 -- 2020-11-10\n\n* Third version revised C. Fixed issue with the reverse
  order of the output for the rewritePoemG executable.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-11-12\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added the possibility to use constraints from the phonetic-languages-constraints
  package (it is also a new leightweight dependency)\nin the lineVariantsG executable.
  They allows to reduce number of computations needed and explicitly apply additional
  needed grammar rules, extend\nthe extent of understandable text and so on.\n\n##
  0.4.1.0 -- 2020-11-12\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Fixed issue with incorrect
  behaviour because of phonetic-languages-constraints inner issue. Changed the dependency
  boundaries appropriately. Changed \nthe behaviour of the lineVariantsG so that you
  can use no coeffs (specially formatted first command line argument), this then is
  like for the versions before 0.3.0.0. \n\n\n"
