synopsis: Simplified and somewhat optimized version of the phonetic-languages-examples.
changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-lists-examples\n\n##
  0.1.0.0 -- 2020-11-29\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2020-12-01\n\n* Second version. Added a new module Phonetic.Languages.Simplified.Lists.DeEnCoding
  for dealing with intersections using heaps functionality.\nFor lineVariantsG2:\n
  ** Added for this heaps as a new dependency (a lightweight one).\n\n ** Added the
  possibilities to leave the last word in the line on its place (this can lead to
  preserving rhymes in poetry, for example),\nto print either metrices information
  or not.\n\n ** Added the possibility to use multiple metrices at once by using +M
  ... -M blocks of command line arguments. The type of metrics is the first argument
  and\nthe numeric arguments for it (as usual) are all further, then again you can
  specify up to two additional metrices with arguments enclosed by the block\n+M and
  -M delimiters.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-12-03\n\n* Third version. Extended the multiple
  properties mode up to 4 different properties. Added the possibility to use more\nintercation
  by interactive mode and to write the single line result to file in file writing
  mode.\nSome documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-12-03\n\n* Fourth
  version. Added the new properties ralated to the uzpp2Durat3 function -- 03y, y3
  (and yy2 related to \nuzpp2Durat2 function). \n"
