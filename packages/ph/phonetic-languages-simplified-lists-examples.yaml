  # Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-lists-examples

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-11-29

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-12-01

  * Second version. Added a new module Phonetic.Languages.Simplified.Lists.DeEnCoding for dealing with intersections using heaps functionality.
  For lineVariantsG2:
   ** Added for this heaps as a new dependency (a lightweight one).

   ** Added the possibilities to leave the last word in the line on its place (this can lead to preserving rhymes in poetry, for example),
  to print either metrices information or not.

   ** Added the possibility to use multiple metrices at once by using +M ... -M blocks of command line arguments. The type of metrics is the first argument and
  the numeric arguments for it (as usual) are all further, then again you can specify up to two additional metrices with arguments enclosed by the block
  +M and -M delimiters.
