synopsis: Rename photo image files based on EXIF shoot date
changelog: ! "3.3 (2017-12-27)\n\n   * A variety of build-related fixes were made\n\n\n3.2
  (2016-10-02)\n\n   * Switched the build from cabal to stack\n   * Added hsinstall
  installation script\n   * Update copyright year\n   * Various updates to the cabal
  file\n\n\n3.1 (2015-06-28)\n\n   * Removed ambiguous import of `System.Locale.defaultTimeLocale`\n
  \  * Updated to use `Data.Version` to fish the version out of cabal info\n   * Replaced
  deprecated ErrorT with ExceptT\n   * Added pragma for Control.Applicative import\n
  \  * Updated README and cabal file with current info\n   * Moved copyright year
  up to 2015\n\n\n3.0.1 (2012-11-01)\n\n   * Updated test suite to build cleanly (without
  warnings) and\n     run against modern cabal versions\n   * Updated cabal file to
  modern cabal standards. Unit testing is\n     now cabal-driven and we now fully
  support cabal sdist.\n   * Fixed a problem where try is no longer available. Now
  importing\n     Control.Exception to bring it into scope.\n   * Adjusted usage to
  explain a change in how we find the EXIF\n     date stamps\n   * Moved copyright
  year up to 2012\n\n\n3.0.0 (2011-05-08)\n\n   * New naming scheme that uses date/time
  only, no serial. This\n     is a BIG change but the old naming scheme is still available.\n
  \  * Parent directory is now a switch\n   * Subdirectory path creation of year and
  day can be suppressed\n   * User can specify an arbitrary suffix string for the
  new names\n   * User can now put switches into a config file\n\n\n2.3.0 (2010-01-25)\n\n
  \  * Problem fixed that had recently come up with the Exif\n     library. Specifically,
  files with no EXIF data were causing\n     an IO error to be thrown and processing
  to halt. (thanks to\n     Josh Hoyt)\n   * Other minor updates to things like copyright
  info and version\n     number\n\n\n2.2 (2009-06-07)\n\n   * No changes in how the
  software behaves\n   * Updated build-depends to be explicit about base version\n
  \    requirement\n   * Minor update to BSD3 copyright notices to bring them up to
  2009\n   * Debian binary package of v2.2 available\n\n\n2.1 (2008-10-11)\n\n   *
  More big changes to the transformers used. No longer using\n     WriterT. Now using
  ErrorT for error handling.\n   * Changed to record-style data for the arg parsing.
  \n\n\n2.0 (2008-03-05)\n\n   * Upgraded to build under GHC 6.8.2\n   * Major internal
  changes. Now using ReaderT and WriterT\n   * Changed version numbering scheme to
  be more conventional. Recent\n     versions of cabal were not amused with the strange
  version\n     string.\n   * This project now added to HackageDB \n\n\n003 (2007-09-13)\n\n
  \  * Repairs for a build problem with GHC > 6.6 specifically related\n     to depending
  on FilePath instead of filepath and now requiring\n     import of Data.Time.Format\n\n\n002
  (2007-04-28)\n\n   * Initial release\n"
