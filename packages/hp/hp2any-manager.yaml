description: ! 'The hp2any history manager

  ==========================


  The history manager is a simple application that can display heap

  profiles of Haskell programs. Graphs are arranged like in a tiling

  window manager. The main window is divided into columns, and each

  column can hold several graphs. New columns can be added with the +

  button on the right hand side, while each column can be closed with

  its respective Close button at the top.


  Heap profiles can be loaded by clicking the Open button at the bottom

  of the column we want them to appear in. The open dialog has

  multi-selection enabled. If more than one .hp file is selected, all of

  them will be loaded in the same column.


  Each graph has a header with some buttons. The first button brings up

  a menu with some viewing options, the second and third can be used to

  move the graph to neighbouring columns, and the last one closes the

  file. Graphs can be zoomed in and out using the mouse wheel, and

  navigated using the scroll bar below them. The view is automatically

  zoomed to fit the highest point of the graph section shown. The actual

  coordinates are shown on a tooltip.


  Besides the graph, every profile window shows a list of cost

  centres. The list can be reordered according to the total cost by

  clicking on the header of the second column. As the mouse moves over

  the graph, the corresponding item is highlighted in the list.
