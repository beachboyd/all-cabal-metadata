synopsis: Real-time heap graphing utility and profile stream server with a reusable
  graphing module.
changelog: ! "0.5.4.2 - 140723\n* fixed possible crash caused by unhandled exceptions
  from canonicalizePath\n\n0.5.4.1 - 140615\n* introduced the ServerOnly compilation
  flag to avoid unnecessary dependency\n  on OpenGL and GLUT in a server environment\n\n0.5.4
  - 130304\n* fixed compilation with ghc-7.6 by Daniel Seidel and SÃ¶nke Hahn\n\n0.5.3
  - 110413\n* updated for the latest parseargs\n* cleaned up warnings\n\n0.5.2 - 091121\n*
  updated for the latest OpenGL\n\n0.5.1 - 090812\n* adjusted path handling code to
  be more robust (so it works on\n  Windows too)\n\n0.5.0 - 090811\n* made GraphData
  abstract (the users don't need its internals)\n* switched to GLUT\n* removed no-grapher
  flag\n* added a simple test example\n\n0.4.1 - 090809\n* added no-grapher flag to
  cabal due to GLFW breakage\n\n0.4.0 - 090802\n* unified some functions by introducing
  the graph mode type\n\n0.3.0 - 090729\n* can handle the case when the executable
  doesn't create a .hp file or\n  doesn't even start\n\n0.2.0 - 090717\n* factored
  OpenGL graphing capabilities into a library\n\n0.1.0 - 090629\n* added a basic relay
  server\n* added remote profiling capability to the grapher\n\n0.0.0 - 090613\n*
  first public version featuring separate and cumulative graphs as\n  well\n"

description: ! 'This package contains two utilities: a grapher that can display heap

  profiles in real time both for local and remote processes, and a

  relay application the grapher connects to in the latter case.

  Additionally, the graphing capability is exposed to other programs

  as well in the form of a library module.


  To avoid the need for OpenGL on the server side, the package can be

  built with the @ServerOnly@ flag:


  @cabal install --flags=serveronly@'
