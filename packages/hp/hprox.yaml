  ## hprox

  hprox is a lightweight HTTP/HTTPS proxy server.

  ### Features

  * Basic HTTP proxy support, including HTTP GET/HTTP CONNECT support.
  * Simple password authentication.
  * HTTPS encryption support, requires a valid certificate. Supports TLS 1.3 and
    HTTP 2 out of box. This mode is also known as SPDY Proxy.
  * TLS SNI validation in HTTPS mode. Blocks connections with wrong domain name.
  * Provide PAC file for easy client side configuration. Supports Chrome and Firefox.
  * Can run upon any Haskell Web Application with `wai` interface. Defaults to
    a dumb application which simulate the default empty page from Apache.
  * websocket redirection. Compatible with v2ray-plugin for shadowsocks.
  * Reverse proxy support. Redirect requests to a fallback server.

  Use `hprox --help` to list the options for further details.

  ### Installation
