  # Revision history for hpath-io

  ## 0.10.1 -- 2020-01-13

  * Move file check functions to HPath.IO
  * Add 'doesExist'
  * Exception handling of `doesExist`, `doesFileExist`, `doesDirectoryExist` has changed: only eNOENT is catched
  * Exception handling of `isWritable` has changed: just a wrapper around `access` now
  * switch exception handling to `safe-exceptions`
  * Redo file reading API (readFileEOF dropped and now using streamly under the hood, added `readFileStream`)


  ## 0.10.0 -- 2020-01-04

  * First version. Split from 'hpath', contains only the IO parts.
  * Now uses streamly for 'copyFile'
  * Fixed tmpdir in hspec

  High-level IO operations on files/directories, utilizing type-safe Paths.

  This package is part of the HPath suite, also check out [hpath](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpath) and [hpath-filepath](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpath-filepath).

  ## Motivation

  The motivation came during development of
  [hsfm](https://github.com/hasufell/hsfm)
  in order to have a proper high-level API of file related operations,
  while utilizing type-safe Paths.

  ## Goals

  * high-level API to file operations like recursive directory copy
  * still allowing sufficient control to interact with the underlying low-level calls
  * unit-testing exceptions (because yes, people may rely on them)

  Note: this library was written for __posix__ systems and it will probably not support other systems.

  ## Differences to 'posix-paths'

  * has a custom versions of `openFd` which allows more control over the flags than its unix package counterpart
  * adds a `getDirectoryContents'` version that works on Fd
