  High-level IO operations on files/directories, utilizing type-safe Paths.

  ## Motivation

  The motivation came during development of
  [hsfm](https://github.com/hasufell/hsfm)
  in order to have a proper high-level API of file related operations,
  while utilizing type-safe Paths.

  ## Goals

  * high-level API to file operations like recursive directory copy
  * still allowing sufficient control to interact with the underlying low-level calls
  * unit-testing exceptions (because yes, people may rely on them)

  Note: this library was written for __posix__ systems and it will probably not support other systems.

  ## Differences to 'posix-paths'

  * has a custom versions of `openFd` which allows more control over the flags than its unix package counterpart
  * adds a `getDirectoryContents'` version that works on Fd
