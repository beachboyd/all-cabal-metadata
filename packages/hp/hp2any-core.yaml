synopsis: Heap profiling helper library
changelog: ! "0.11.2 - 130304\n* various improvements by Takano Akio and SÃ¶nke Hahn\n\n0.11.1
  - 111117\n* improved parsing performance by Claude Heiland-Allen\n\n0.10.1 - 110413\n*
  cleaned up warnings\n\n0.10.0 - 090812\n* changed processToProfile to accept parameters
  as a list of strings\n* added some preliminary Win32 code that still doesn't work
  due to\n  sharing violations\n\n0.9.0 - 090810\n* switched to Int64 for representing
  costs\n* added a Maybe layer to readProfile as well\n\n0.8.0 - 090802\n* introduced
  profile query class to provide some flexibility\n* introduced the statistics module\n\n0.7.0
  - 090731\n* threw out most of the network protocol, which was obsoleted by the\n
  \ idea that the grapher is provided as a library instead of a remote\n  controlled
  application\n\n0.6.0 - 090729\n* added a Maybe layer to the return values of profiling
  functions\n\n0.5.0 - 090720\n* added the ability to stop an asynchronous loading
  operation\n\n0.4.0 - 090718\n* added asynchronous loading\n\n0.3.0 - 090705\n* added
  interface for remote profiling, moved in networking code from\n  the grapher and
  the relay test apps\n* modified stopper action to acknowledge the end of profiling
  by\n  invoking the callback with SinkStop\n* hid internals and tests\n\n0.2.0 -
  090624\n* network protocol implemented (un/marshalling functions)\n\n0.1.0 - 090613\n*
  added interface to specify profiling parameters\n* added stopper action that terminates
  the reader thread in a clean way\n* switched to bytestrings\n\n0.0.0 - 090528\n*
  basic functionality: profileCallback, profile, readProfile, and querying\n"

description: ! "Testing:\n\n1. Go to the test directory and compile tester.\n2. Load
  Profiling.Heap.Read into ghci.\n3. Change to the dir that contains the cabal file
  (you should be\n   already there if you performed the second step from Emacs).\n4.
  Now you can try _test{1,2,3} as you please. You might want to delete\n   test/tester.hp
  between tests.\n"
