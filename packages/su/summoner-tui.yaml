  _So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and\n>
  then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable._\n>\n> Christopher Reeve\n\nSummoner
  is a tool for scaffolding fully configured batteries-included production-level Haskell
  projects.\n\nDo you want to create a library that is to be uploaded to Hackage/Stackage,
  that builds with both Cabal and Stack and supports the latest three major GHC versions?\nOr
  you are building a production application which uses a custom prelude and has CI
  with Travis Linux and AppVeyors Windows checks?\nSummoner can help you do all that
  with minimal effort from you - it can even upload the project to GitHub if you wish!\n\nBy
  the way, Summoner operates as either CLI or TUI application, so you can choose what
  you're more comfortable with and install only the required one.\n\n## Structure\n\n*

  Examples of scaffolded projects](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/tree/master/summoner-cli/test/golden)\n\nDirectory
  `smallProject` contains an example of the straightforward package, and `fullProject`
  shows a generated project with more advanced structure and more features.\n\n##
  Features [↑](#structure)\n\nSummoner is a tool that combines predefined configurations,
  command-line arguments and a chosen interface.\n\nTo fully understand the power
  in your hands with the help of Summoner, please check out this section.\n\nBelow
  you can see highlighted features in different categories.\n\n### Project [↑](#structure)\n\n+
  Support for Cabal and Stack build tools.\n+ Ability to pick stanzas (library, executable,
  test-suite, benchmark).\n+ Option to include an alternative prelude, if desired.
  The project would then use [`base-noprelude` technique](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Prelude),
  and the `Prelude` module would be added to the library target.\n+ Whole Hackage-upload
  checklist support.\n+ Support for multiple GHC versions, with thoughtful reflection
  on project meta, base versions (e.g. `base >= 4.9 && < 4.12`), etc.\n+ Ability to
  create runnable Haskell scripts.\n+ Different license support: MIT, BSD2, BSD3,
  GPL-2, GPL-3, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3, AGPL-3, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, None (All Rights Reserved
  license without file).\n+ Creation of the `CHANGELOG.md` file with [PVP versioning
  policy](https://pvp.haskell.org).\n+ Ability to include your `.stylish-haskell.yaml`
  file.\n+ Usage of the `ghc-options` field with sensible defaults.\n\n  If `ghc-options`
  are not explicitly stated in the configuration file, then the following list of
  GHC flags is added to all stanzas:\n\n  ```\n  -Wall\n  -Wincomplete-uni-patterns\n
  \ -Wincomplete-record-updates\n  -Wcompat\n  -Widentities\n  -Wredundant-constraints
  \     (ghc >= 8.0)\n  -fhide-source-paths          (ghc >= 8.2.2)\n  -Wmissing-export-lists
  \      (ghc >= 8.4.1)\n  -Wpartial-fields             (ghc >= 8.4.1)\n  ```\n\n
  \ Besides, the following GHC options are added to the executable, tests and benchmark
  stanzas:\n\n  ```\n  -threaded\n  -rtsopts\n  -with-rtsopts=-N\n  ```\n\n### GitHub
  [↑](#structure)\n\n+ Initialisation of the git repository inside the project folder.\n+
  Initial commit creation.\n+ Uploading the repository to GitHub.\n+ Exhaustive `.gitignore`
  file.\n+ Formation of the `README` file with Hackage, Stackage and CI badges.\n+
  Linking to the GitHub repository in the `.cabal` file.\n+ Ability to include your
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.\n+ Guessing user credentials from `.gitconfig`.\n\n### CI
  [↑](#structure)\n\n+ Generation of the `.travis.yml` file that runs build and tests
  on CI under Linux using\n  [Dead simple Haskell Travis Settings for Cabal and Stack](https://chshersh.github.io/posts/2019-02-25-haskell-travis).\n+
  Configuration matrix on CI to build with multiple GHC versions and various build
  tools.\n+ `-Werror` is enabled on CI not to miss any warnings.\n+ Run HLint checks
  on CI.\n+ Generation of the `appveyor.yaml` file which runs build and tests on CI
  under Windows.\n\n### Others [↑](#structure)\n\n+ Ability to create a project in
  offline mode.\n\n## Get started [↑](#structure)\n\n### Prerequisites [↑](#structure)\n\nTo
  start using Summoner make sure that you have the following tools installed on your
  machine:\n\n* [`git`](https://git-scm.com) – to initialize the GitHub repo.\n* [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub)
  – to upload the project to GitHub.\n* [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se) – to download
  licenses.\n\n### Installation [↑](#structure)\n\nSummon contains two executables:\n\n*
  `summon`: scaffold projects using interactive CLI mode.\n* `summon-tui`: scaffold
  projects using TUI.\n\nBelow you can find the description of how to install each
  of them so you can choose the one you want.\n\n#### Summon-TUI [↑](#structure)\n\n>
  **NOTE:** `summon-tui` is not supported on Windows. See [this issue](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/vty/pull/1).\n\n#####
  TUI: download binary [↑](#structure)\n\nYou can download binary directly [from GitHub
  releases](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/releases).\n\nAfter downloading binary,
  make it executable and copy it under convenient location, for example:\n\n```shell\nchmod
  +x summon-cli-linux\nmv summon-cli-linux ~/.local/bin/summon\n```\n\n##### TUI:
  from source [↑](#structure)\n\nFetch the repo using `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal
  get -s summoner\n```\n\nor clone the directory from GitHub:\n\n```shell\ngit clone
  https://github.com/kowainik/summoner.git\n```\n\nStep into the directory:\n\n```haskell\ncd
  summoner\n```\n\nBuild and install using `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal new-install
  summoner-tui:exe:summon-tui\n```\n\nBuild and install using `stack`:\n\n```shell\nstack
  install summoner-tui:exe:summon-tui\n```\n\n#### Summon-CLI [↑](#structure)\n\n#####
  CLI: download binary [↑](#structure)\n\nYou can download binary directly [from GitHub
  releases](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/releases).\n\nAfter downloading binary,
  make it executable and copy it under convenient location, for example:\n\n```shell\nchmod
  +x summon-cli-linux\nmv summon-cli-linux ~/.local/bin/summon\n```\n\n##### CLI:
  from Hackage/Stackage [↑](#structure)\n\nUsing `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal new-update\ncabal
  new-install summoner\n```\n\nUsing `stack`:\n\n```shell\nstack install summoner\n```\n\n#####
  CLI: from source [↑](#structure)\n\nFetch the repo using `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal
  get -s summoner\n```\n\nor clone the directory from GitHub:\n\n```shell\ngit clone
  https://github.com/kowainik/summoner.git\n```\n\nStep into the directory:\n\n```haskell\ncd
  summoner\n```\n\nBuild and install using `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal new-install
  summoner-cli:exe:summon\n```\n\nBuild and install using `stack`:\n\n```shell\nstack
  install summoner:exe:summon\n```\n\n### Setup [↑](#structure)\n\nYou can turn on
  bash auto-completion by running the following command:\n\n```shell\nsource <(summon
  --bash-completion-script `which summon`)\n```\n\n## Usage [↑](#structure)\n\nTo
  start `summon`ing projects nothing additional is required. However, to tweak your
  settings further, you can use additional configuration settings.\nThere are several
  options you can use to set particular configurations for new projects (in increasing
  order of priority):\n\n1. Default configuration file (`~/.summoner.toml`).\n2. Fields
  `user.login`, `user.name` and `user.email` from `~/.gitconfig`.\n3. Explicitly specified
  configuration file by `--file FILENAME` option (used instead of the default one
  if specified).\n4. Options that are stated by CLI arguments.\n5. User input. It
  could be\n    * **TUI** – User data specified in the window of `summon-tui`.\n    *
  **CLI** – Interactively inputted answers during execution of the `summon` command
  (for the options that were not specified on previous steps).\n\nTo cut a long story
  short, the configuration uses [Partial Options Monoid Pattern](https://medium.com/@jonathangfischoff/the-partial-options-monoid-pattern-31914a71fc67).\n\n###
  File configuration [↑](#structure)\n\nHere is the list of the options that can be
  configured to suit your needs. If options are not specified, they are asked interactively
  (or some sensible defaults are used).\n\n| Field            | Type    | Description
  \                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

  **Section 1** – The main section where user inputs data or changes the configurations.\n\n>
  **Section 2** – The structure of the project that is going to be created with the
  current configurations. This tree changes on-the-fly.\n\n> **Section 3** – Hints,
  project status, or current errors in the configurations.\n\n> **Section 4** – Useful
  hotkeys.\n\nThe TUI window opens with the pre-filled information received from a
  config file and command-line arguments. However, it's possible to change any field
  as per your needs.\n\nIn the screenshot you can see that you'll be given a few text
  fields to fill in or some checkboxes that represent boolean values of the configurations.
  To help you fill in the correct input, there are some ⓘ info messages in the `Status`
  section, which give additional details about the current field.\n\nTo help you navigate
  between the form fields here are the available hotkeys:\n\n| Key                               |
  Action                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|
  <kbd>Esc</kbd>                    | Abort `summoner`                                                                     |\n|
  <kbd>Enter</kbd>                  | If input is valid go to the Confirm window                                           |\n|
  <kbd>Tab</kbd>                    | Change the focus to the next active field                                            |\n|
  <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Change the focus to the previous active field
  \                                       |\n| <kbd>Space</kbd>                  |
  Enable/disable current checkbox or radio button                                      |\n|
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>    | Delete the input of the current text field                                           |\n|
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>    | Delete the input of the current text field from
  the cursor position to the beginning |\n| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>    | Delete
  the input of the current text field from the cursor position to the end       |\n|
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>    | Move the cursor to the beginning of the current
  input field                          |\n| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>    | Move
  the cursor to the end of the current input field                                |\n|

  that the form should be valid in order to be able to go to the Confirm window. If
  there are some errors in the input, you could see details about these errors in
  the `Status` section of the form.\n\n#### TUI script command [↑](#structure)\n\nSee
  [CLI description](#cli-script-command-) of the `summon script` command.\n\n####
  TUI show command [↑](#structure)\n\nThese commands display the list of supported
  GHC versions or Licenses. Also, when the license name is specified the window with
  the scrollable content of the License text is shown.\n\n### CLI [↑](#structure)\n\n####
  CLI new command [↑](#structure)\n\nIn CLI mode of operation Summoner asks about
  every project setting. Most of the questions contain a default value, so you can
  press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to choose the default value.\nIf some option is specified
  via a configuration file or CLI arguments, then the question is skipped and the
  predefined value is used.\n\n#### CLI script command [↑](#structure)\n\nThis command
  creates minimal `cabal` or `stack` script file which allows you to save some keystrokes
  and eliminates the need to remember magic words for scripts.\n\n**Cabal example:**
  `summon script cabal -n Main.hs` generates executable file `Main.hs` with the following
  content:\n\n```haskell\n#!/usr/bin/env cabal\n{- cabal:\nbuild-depends:\n  , base
  ^>= 4.12.0.0\n-}\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = putStrLn \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\n**Stack
  example:** `summon script stack -n Main.hs` generates executable file `Main.hs`
  with the following content:\n\n```haskell\n#!/usr/bin/env stack\n{- stack\n  --resolver
  lts-13.16\n  script\n  --package base\n-}\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = putStrLn \"Hello,
  World!\"\n```\n\n#### CLI show command [↑](#structure)\n\nThese commands display
  the list of supported GHC versions, or Licenses. Also, when the license name is
  specified, the content of the License is outputted to the terminal.\n\n## FAQ [↑](#structure)\n\n>
  I want to use HTTPS remote for the created GitHub project, but it creates SSH one.
  How should I fix this?\n\nWe are using `hub` tool to create the projects at GitHub.
  It uses SSH so that you would get the remote links in the following format:\n\n```\ngit@github.com:user/repo.git\n```\n\nWe
  can not change or configure this behaviour, but there are several workarounds in
  case you _need_ to use HTTPS link for the remote.\n\n1. Change the remote of the
  repository after its creation:\n   ```\n   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo.git\n
  \  ```\n2. Change `hub` configurations globally. Simply run the following command:\n
  \  ```shell\n   git config --global hub.protocol https\n   ```\n3. Alternatively,
  change `hub` configurations for a single session:\n   ```\n   export HUB_PROTOCOL=\"https\"\n
  \  ```\n\n## For Developers [↑](#structure)\n\nIf you'd like to take part in the
  development processes, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* Summoner is a
  multi-package project which has two packages inside: `summoner-cli` and `summoner-tui`.
  We are supporting the same functionality in both of them, so, if it's possible,
  you should add/change the code in both of the packages.\n* Summoner uses the custom
  prelude [`relude`](https://github.com/kowainik/relude).\n* We are using the [Kowainik
  style guide](https://github.com/kowainik/org/blob/master/style-guide.md#haskell-style-guide).\n*
  To sum up, [here is the Contributing guide](https://github.com/kowainik/org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-kowainik-repositories)
  we use across the repositories.\n* This project is contributor-friendly, so be kind
  to other people working on the project.\n\n### Dependencies [↑](#structure)\n\nOn
  Linux, to build the `summoner-tui` you'll need to have `libtinfo` installed. The
  easiest way to get this is from your system's package manager and is usually available
  as the package `libtinfo-dev`.\n\n### Build [↑](#structure)\n\nTo build the project
  you can use the following commands:\n\n```shell=\ncabal new-build all\n```\n\nfor
  Cabal and\n\n```shell=\nstack build\n```\n\nfor Stack.\n\n### Test [↑](#structure)\n\nSummoner
  uses the golden tests technique for assuring the correctness of the generated files.
  For this purpose, we have [the `golden` folder](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/tree/master/summoner-cli/test/golden)
  with two sample projects to test against.\n\nTo actually run tests you need to run:\n\n```shell\ncabal
  new-test all\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\nstack test\n```\n\n### Run [↑](#structure)\n\nBuilding
  Summoner with the recommended method creates two executables: `summon` and `summon-tui`.
  To run the compiled executable you can use the following commands:\n\n```shell\ncabal
  new-exec summon -- SOME_COMMAND\ncabal new-exec summon-tui -- SOME_COMMAND\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\nstack
  exec summon -- SOME_COMMAND\nstack exec summon-tui -- SOME_COMMAND\n```\n\n## Changelog
  [↑](#structure)\n\nEach package has its own changelog:\n\n* [Summoner changelog](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/blob/master/summoner-cli/CHANGELOG.md#changelog).\n*
  [Summoner-TUI changelog](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/blob/master/summoner-tui/CHANGELOG.md#changelog).\n\n##
