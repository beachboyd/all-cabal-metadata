description: ! "# Haskell SuperBuffer\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/agrafix/superbuffer.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/agrafix/superbuffer)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/superbuffer.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/superbuffer)\n\nThe
  `superbuffer` packages was designed to efficiently build up bytestrings from `IO`
  actions producing\nsmaller chunks. The goal was to reduce memory overhead as much
  as possible while still being as fast as possible.\nIn our use case, it reduced
  total memory usage of the program from `350 MB` (`bytestring` builder) to `50 MB`
  (`superbuffer`).\nFor speed see benchmarks below. Note that the speed heavily depends
  on a good choice of the initial buffer size. `superbuffer` outperforms or performs
  similar to the `bytestring` alternatives consistently. `superbuffer` outperforms
  `buffer-builder`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}\nmodule
  Example where\n\nimport Data.ByteString.SuperBuffer\nimport qualified Data.ByteString
  as BS\n\nmyBS :: IO BS.ByteString\nmyBS =\n    -- note: performance of superbuffer
  heavily depends on a\n    -- smart choice of the initial buffer size. Benchmark
  to\n    -- find what suits your needs.\n    withBuffer 1024 $ \\buf ->\n    do appendBuffer
  buf \"Hello \"\n       appendBuffer buf \"World!\"\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nSee:
