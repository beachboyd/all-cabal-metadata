changelog: ! "ChangeLog\n\nv0.1.2.7 2018/05/07\n\t(2018/05/07) PS1 - this version
  of the package only works with\n\tCabal 2.2 or greater. This can be installed (even
  with earlier\n\tversions of ghc) by \"cabal update cabal\". If for some reason an\n\tearlier
  version of Cabal is needed, use superdoc-0.1.2.6.\n\nv0.1.2.6 2018/05/07\n\t(2018/05/07)
  PS1 - this version of the package does not work with\n\tCabal 2.2, so specify Cabal
  < 2.2\n\nv0.1.2.5 2017/11/09\n\t(2017/11/09) PS1 - updated the package to work with
  Cabal 2.0.\n\nv0.1.2.4 2016/07/27\n\t(2016/07/27) PS1 - loosened package dependencies
  to accommodate\n\tolder versions of ghc and base.\n\nv0.1.2.3 2016/07/11\n\t(2016/07/11)
  PS1 - updated package dependencies.\n\t(2016/07/11) PS1 - updated Unicode armor
  so it doesn't clash with\n\tHaddock's new boldface feature.\n\nv0.1.2.2 2015/08/15\n\t(2015/08/15)
  PS1 - relaxed package dependencies.\n\nv0.1.2.1 2014/10/08\n\t(2014/10/07) PS1 -
  updated dependencies to permit base 4.7 and\n\tCabal >= 1.16.\n\nv0.1.2.0 2014/02/12\n\t(2014/02/12)
  PS1 - added new \"center\" tag, for centering.\n\nv0.1.1.0 2013/12/14\n\t(2013/12/14)
  PS1 - added a bootstrapping mode, so that Superdoc\n\tcan generate its own documentation
  when it is not yet installed.\n\nv0.1.0.0 2013/12/10\n\tInitial public release.\n"

description: ! 'This package extends Cabal''s documentation building capabilities.

  It extends the Haddock markup language with syntax for subscripts,

  superscripts, bold text, non-breaking spaces, and images. Moreover,

  it works around various bugs in Haddock''s and HsColour''s Unicode

  support, making it possible to use UTF8 encodings in both source

  code and documentation comments.


  This package is designed to work transparently. It provides a custom

  main function that package maintainers can use in their Setup.hs

  file. In most cases, this is as simple as setting the build-type to

  Custom, adding superdoc to the package dependencies, and putting the

  following two lines into Setup.hs:


  > import Distribution.Superdoc

  > main = superdocMain


  For more information on the available markup, see "Distribution.Superdoc".'
