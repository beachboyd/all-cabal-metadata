description: ! 'Tikz is often used to draw graphs (i.e., networks) in LaTeX. Even
  though the resulting image can be very clean, manually writing tikz code can be
  time consuming, especially when the picture needs to be modified afterwards.

  On the other side of the spectrum, drawing with graphical tools like inkscape is
  easy, but getting a clean looking result can be complicated.

  With pictikz you get the best of both worlds: You draw using a graphical tool and
  pictikz converts the resulting SVG file to tikz code, making some automatic style
  adjustments if you desire.'
