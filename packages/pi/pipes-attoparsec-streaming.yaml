description: ! 'This module exports the single function parse, which can be used to

  run an Attoparsec parser in a streaming fashion, which means that

  the parser is not only run incrementally across the input (which

  can be done with plain Attoparsec or packages like

  pipes-attoparsec), but that the parse results are delivered

  incrementally.  This package can be seen as a kind of dual to

  pipes-attoparsec: the latter runs parser incrementally over their

  input, whereas the former incrementally delivers output.'
