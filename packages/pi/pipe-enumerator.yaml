description: ! 'This library defines a set of functions that convert between

  the "Pipes" and "Data.Enumerator" paradigms. The conversion

  is bidirectional: an appropriately-typed pipe can be converted

  into an ''Data.Enumerator.Iteratee'' and back into a pipe.

  In addition, a pipe can be fed into an iteratee

  (or, more specifically, ''Data.Enumerator.Step''),

  resulting in an ''Data.Enumerator.Enumerator''.

  The library has been designed specifically for use with Snap,

  but I''m sure that many other interesting uses of it exist.'
