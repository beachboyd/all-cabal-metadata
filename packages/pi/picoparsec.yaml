synopsis: Fast combinator parsing for bytestrings and text
changelog: ! "0.1\n\n* Fixed the incorrect tracking of capacity if the initial buffer
  was\n  empty (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/75)\n\n0.12.1.1\n\n* Fixed
  a data corruption bug that occurred under some circumstances\n  if a buffer grew
  after prompting for more input\n  (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/74)\n\n0.12.1.0\n\n*
  Now compatible with GHC 7.9\n\n* Reintroduced the Chunk class, used by the parsers
  package\n\n0.12.0.0\n\n* A new internal representation makes almost all real-world
  parsers\n  faster, sometimes by big margins.  For example, parsing JSON data\n  with
  aeson is now up to 70% faster.  These performance improvements\n  also come with
  reduced memory consumption and some new capabilities.\n\n* The new match combinator
  gives both the result of a parse and the\n  input that it matched.\n\n* The test
  suite has doubled in size.  This made it possible to switch\n  to the new internal
  representation with a decent degree of\n  confidence that everything was more or
  less working.\n\n* The benchmark suite now contains a small family of benchmarks
  taken\n  from real-world uses of attoparsec.\n\n* A few types that ought to have
  been private now are.\n\n* A few obsolete modules and functions have been marked
  as deprecated.\n  They will be removed from the next major release.\n\n\n* Initial
  commit.\n"
