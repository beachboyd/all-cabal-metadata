description: ! 'A library for writing build systems in Haskell, built on top of

  <http://shakebuild.com shake>.


  Pier provides a generic approach to building and caching file outputs.

  It enables build actions to be written in a "forwards" style, which

  generally leads to simpler logic than backwards-defined build systems

  such as make or (normal) Shake, where each step of the build logic must

  be written as a new build rule.
