changelog: ! "# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: We now depend on `network-simple-0.3`,
  which introduced some\n  breaking changes. Please refer to its\n  [changelog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-simple-0.3/changelog).\n\n*
  Remove `Pipes.Safe.Base m ~ IO` constraints.\n\n* Remove upper-bound constraints
  on all dependencies other than `base`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.1\n\n* Dependency bumps.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.2.0\n\n* Significantly upgraded the API and renamed functions to play
  well with\n  pipes-4.0, pipes-safe-2.0, pipes-network-0.6 and\n  network-simple-tls-0.2.\n\n*
  Throw `IOError` in `IO` in order to report timeout errors. Delete\n  the `Timeout`
  data-type.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.1.0\n\n* Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo`\n\n\n#
  Version 0.1.0.0\n\n* First release.\n"
