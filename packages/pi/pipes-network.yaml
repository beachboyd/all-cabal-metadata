synopsis: Use network sockets together with the pipes library.
changelog: ! "# Version 0.6.5\n\n* Remover upper bound on all dependencies except
  `base`.\n\n* Fixed internal error handling in server-side functions.\n\n* Re-export
  `MonadSafe`.\n\n\n# Version 0.6.4.1\n\n* Raise upper-bound dependency on `transformers`
  and `pipes`.\n\n\n# Version 0.6.4\n\n* The various `fromServe` and `toServe*` pipes
  from\n  `Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe` now close the listening socket immediately\n  after
  accepting a first connection.\n\n* Re-export `sendLazy`, `sendMany` and `closeSock`.\n\n*
  Add `to{Socket,SocketTimeout,Serve,Connect}{Lazy,Many}`.\n\n* Fix issue #29 where
  `fromSocketTimeout` and `fromSocketTimeoutN`\n  would loop forever.\n\n\n# Version
  0.6.3\n\n* Bump `network-simple`, `transformers` and `pipes-safe` upper bounds.\n\n*
  Remove `Base m ~ IO` constraints from `Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe`, as\n  not all of
  them were removed in 0.6.1.\n\n\n# Version 0.6.2\n\n* Dependency bumps (upper bounds).\n\n\n#
  Version 0.6.1\n\n* Remove the `Base m ~ IO` constraint from `Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe`\n\n\n#
  Version 0.6.0\n\n* Significantly upgraded the API and renamed functions to play
  well with\n  pipes-4.0.0, pipes-safe-2.0.0 and network-simple-0.3.0.\n\n* Throw
  `IOError` in `IO` in order to report timeout errors. Delete\n  the `Timeout` data-type.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.5.1.0\n\n* Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo`.\n\n* Use TCP `send`
  and `recv` as eported by network-simple-0.2.1.0.\n\n\n# Version 0.5.0.0\n\n* Removed
  `Control.Proxy.TCP.Sync` and `Control.Proxy.TCP.Safe.Sync`.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.1\n\n*
  FIX: `acceptFork` now properly closes the connection socket, even in\n  case of
  asynchronous exceptions.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.0\n\n* Do not handle “Broken Pipe”
  errors on the `*Write*D` proxies anymore.\n  As as a result, those proxies run forever
  and have a polymorphic\n  return value, which makes this release binary compatible
  with 0.2.0.0,\n  but not with 0.3.0.0.\n\n\n# Version 0.3.0.0\n\n* Quietly stop
  writing or reading bytes from a TCP socket if a\n  “Broken Pipe” error happens,
  indicating that the remote end\n  already closed the connection. Previously, a `ResourceVanished`\n
  \ exception was thrown.\n\n* All the `*Write*D` proxies now return `()` if the remote
  end\n  closed the connection.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0.0\n\n* Depend on network-simple
  0.2\n\n* In both modules `Control.Proxy.TCP` and `Control.Proxy.TCP.Safe`:\n  `serveFork`
  was renamed to `serve` and the previous function named\n  `serve` was removed.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.1.1.0\n\n* Split many of the non-pipes-related TCP utilities to the own\n
  \ `network-simple` package.\n* Depend on `network-simple` and re-export its functions.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.1.0.1\n\n* Dependency bumps.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0\n\n* New backwards incompatible
  API\n* Based on pipes 3.1\n\n\n# Up to version 0.0.2\n\n* Based on pipes-core.\n"
