description: ! 'Pier is a command-line tool for building Haskell projects.  It is

  similar in purpose to <https://www.haskellstack.org Stack>,

  but explores a different design:


  * Pier implements the fine-grained Haskell build logic from (nearly)

  scratch.  In contrast, Stack relies on Cabal to implement most of its

  build steps, giving it a more coarse control over the build.

  * Pier uses general-purpose libraries for implementing build systems, namely

  <https://shakebuild.com Shake> and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pier-core
  pier-core>.

  documentation>.'
