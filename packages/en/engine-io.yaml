  * Increased the upper-bound of `free` to < 5.1.

  * Increased the lower-bound of `websockets` to 0.11.

  ## 1.2.18

  ### Other Changes

  * Switch from `either` to `errors`.

  ## 1.2.17

  ### Other Changes

  * Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to < 1.3.
  * Increased the upper-bound of `websockets` to < 0.13.

  ## 1.2.16

  ### Other Changes

  * Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to < 1.2.

  ## 1.2.15

  * Increased the upper-bound of `aeson`, `vector` and `websockets`.

  ## 1.2.14

  * Increased the upper-bound of `base` and `transformers`.

  ## 1.2.13

  * Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to allow < 0.12.

  ## 1.2.12

  * Increased the upper-bound of `async` to allow < 2.2.

  ## 1.2.11

  * Increased the upper-bound of aeson to allow < 0.11.

  ## 1.2.10

  * Increase upper-bound of `vector` to < 0.12.

  ## 1.2.9

  * Same changes as 1.2.8, but the 1.2.8 release was formed incorrectly and didn't
    compile.

  ## 1.2.8

  * Fixed a bug in the heartbeat monitor. The heartbeat thread exists to ensure
    that all connections are still active, so we can detect when a long-polling
    connection is closed. However, older versions of `engine-io`, the timer would
    be reset whenever *we* sent the client a message, rather than only when we
    *received* a message from the client. This meant that for high-traffic
    applications, old connections might never be removed, resulting in a memory
    leak.

  ## 1.2.7

  * Support decoding payloads coming through XHR polling transport.
    Previously, this scenario would lead to HTTP 400 responses.
  * Increased upper bound on `either` to < 4.5.

  ## 1.2.6

  * Increased upper-bounds of aeson to < 0.10 and of attoparsec to < 0.14.

  ## 1.2.5

  * Increased the upper-bound of base to allow < 4.9. Now builds on
    GHC 7.10.1.

  ## 1.2.4

  * Add a 100ms delay in the WebSocket upgrade process. This matches the
    behavior of the reference engine.io implementation (in NodeJS), and
    avoids a race condition on slower machines. Without this, it was
    possible for the client to experience a up-to-45s delay before
    upgrading.

  ## 1.2.3

  * Revert double-encoding introduced in 1.0.1. This now requires that you
    use a modern version of the `socket.io` client library. This work was
    tested against `socket.io-1.2.1.js`.

  ## 1.2.2

  * We now use `stm-delay` to implement a timeout, if we don't *receive*
    network traffic from the client. Under normal operation, the Socket.io
    client should ping the server, so an idle session should remain alive.

  ## 1.2.1

  * Fixed a potential race condition in session allocation, where we could
    clobber existing session ids.

  ## 1.2.0

  * `ServerAPI`'s `srvParseParseRequestBody` has changed its return type to
    `Either String a`. This allows API providers to catch exceptions that may
    happen when attempting to perform this parse.

  ## 1.1.2

  * 1.1.1 accidently removed `websockets` from the list of available upgrades.
    This release reverts that change.

  ## 1.1.1

  * Long-polling connections now emit a `ping` message after 45 seconds, if no
    data is written to them.

  * There is a new `dupRawReader` function, which lets you create a read-only
    stream of raw communication with a socket.

  ## 1.1.0

  * The `ServerAPI` functions `srvWriteBuilder`, `srvSetContentType` and
    `srvSetResponseCode` have been merged into a single function:
    `srvTerminateWithResponse`. This should allow `ServerAPI` to be provided for
    Yesod.

    Thanks to Tim Baumann (@timjb) for this change.

  ## 1.0.2

  * The `ping` thread spawned by `websockets` is now disabled, as it has been
    observed that these pings are using invalid sockets. Specifically, see
    https://github.com/lpsmith/postgresql-simple/issues/117.

  ## 1.0.1

  * Purposefully double-encode websocket traffic. Unfortunately this is necessary
    due to https://github.com/Automattic/engine.io-client/issues/322. When a new
    version of `engine.io` is released upstream, I will revert this.

description: |-
  This library provides a Haskell implementation of
  <https://github.com/Automattic/engine.io Engine.IO>, a library for real-time
  client-server communication on the web. Engine.IO works with old browsers via
  XHR long-polling, and seamlessy upgrades to web sockets. This implementation
  supports the majority of the Engine.IO protocol, including text and binary
  packets and the upgrading protocol.
