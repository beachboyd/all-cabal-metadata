description: ! 'The specification of a class in Haskell often starts with

  stating, in text, the laws that should be satisfied by methods

  defined in instances of the class, followed by the type of the

  methods of the class. The ClassLaws library is a framework that

  supports testing such class laws using QuickCheck.  Our framework is

  a light-weight class law testing framework, which requires a limited

  amount of work per class law, and per datatype for which the class

  law is tested.  We also show how to test class laws with

  partially-defined values.  Using partially-defined values, we show

  that the standard lazy and strict implementations of the state monad

  do not satisfy the expected laws. More information can be found at

  <http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/ClassLaws>.  Built

  with ghc-7.4.2 and ghc-7.6.1. (Fails to build with ghc-7.2.2 due to

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5745>. Could be worked

  around.)'
