description: ! 'A /cluss/ enables you to achieve function overloading, or ad-hoc polymorphism,

  without creating a new type class.


  In order to give ad-hoc polymorphism to a type variable @a@,

  you simply use @''In''@ with a list of \"type patterns\" like @In [Type T, ...]
  a@,

  which indicates that the type matches some of the patterns;

  which is analogous to a type class indicating that a type matches some of its \"instances\".

  The constraint @In [Type T, ...] a@ is what we call a \"cluss\".


  Clusses can easily be used in a nested way

  and even be /recursive/;

  therefore, they are expressive enough to imitate Haskell-98-style type classes.


  Clusses, however, go beyond a mere alternative to type classes.

  They have /closed/ and /prioritized/ instances and /open/ methods,

  while type classes have open and unprioritized instances and closed methods.

  Those properties give clusses the advantages different from type classes:


  * You can judge whether a type @a@ belongs to a cluss @''In'' as@,

  on some level, writing @Has as a@,

  since cluss instances are closed.


  * You can make cluss instances more flexibly,

  without causing overlapping instances or incoherent instances,

  since cluss instances are prioritized.


  * You can create new methods for clusses anywhere in any module,

  since cluss methods are open.
