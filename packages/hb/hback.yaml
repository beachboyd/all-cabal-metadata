description: ! "\nBased on a recent [research paper](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0801268105v1)
  that claims fluid intelligence could be improved by training working memory, I wrote
  up a dual n-back test memory game in Haskell and gtk2hs. This is an alpha release:
  all comments are most welcome.\n\nProject homepage: [http://hback.googlecode.com/]\n\nGameplay\n--------\n\nThe
  n-back memory game tests whether the player can remember if the nth previous turn
  matches the current one. The dual n-back test will measure how well the player can
  remember both visual and graphic stimuli simultaneously.\n\nGiven a difficulty level
  n, the player is expected to remember on each turn whether the nth previous sound
  or graphic (or both) matches the current one, and toggle the appropriate button(s).
  The graphic flashes for 500ms and the player has another 2.5 seconds to answer.\n\nThe
  training game consists of b block iterations, where each block will present (20+n)
  visual and audio stimuli. After each iteration, the difficulty of the n-back test
  may increase or decrease, depending on the performance of the player: the goal is
  to constantly keep the player at peak concentration.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n
  \    % tar -xzf hback-x.y.tar.gz\n     % cd hback-x.y\n\nGame can be played without
  system-wide installation:\n\n     % make trial\n     % ./bin/hback\n\nIf you like
  what you see, feel free to install it:\n\n     % make build\n     % make install
  \   # you may need root privileges for this\n     % rehash\n     % hback\n\nhback
  takes two optional arguments:\n\n     % ./hback b n\n         - b determines the
  number of block iterations (eg. try 20 for an effective daily workout)\n         -
  n determines the initial level (defaults to 1)\n"
