description: ! "A Haskell Binding to some BDD Libraries.\t\t\t-*- Outline -*-\n----------------------------------------\n\nThis
  library provides a convenient abstraction of several BDD packages\nin Haskell. The
  intention is to furnish most useful Boolean operations\nwith a purely functional
  interface, while still allowing access to the\noperational features (like variable
  re-ordering) via the IO monad.\n\nI have abandoned BuDDy support and am focussing
  on CUDD. The CMU/Long\nbinding is of mostly historic interest and has only been
  lightly\ntested in recent years.\n\n* Installing\n\nInstall the CUDD and/or CMU/Long
  BDD packages.\n\nrunghc Setup configure --user -p --enable-library-profiling --ghc-option=-auto-all
  --ghc-option=-caf-all\nrunghc Setup build\nrunghc Setup install\n\nYou may need
  to use Cabal flags --extra-include-dirs and\n--extra-lib-dirs to point it at the
  location of the BDD libraries.\n\n* Documentation\n\nHaddock-generated documentation
  for the Haskell bindings can be found\nin the 'doc' directory. CMU/Long's manpage
  - bdd(3) - is a source of\nvaluable information. Also the documentation for CUDD
  is very readable\n(albeit obscure at times), and the implementation is quite clean.\n\n*
