description: ! "====\nhbro\n====\n\n**In a nutshell**, *hbro* is a minimal web browser
  for linux. It is written, configured and extensible in Haskell.\n\nInformation about
  versions, dependencies, source repositories and contacts can be found in hackage_.\n\n\nDesign
  principles\n-----------------\n\n`Do one thing well`_\n  A web browser is **not**
  a {window|bookmarks|history|download|passwords|package} manager, let alone an operating
  system.\n  A web browser retrieves, renders and traverses web pages, period.\n\n`Keep
  It Simple, Stupid`_\n  The application should be written with simplicity in mind,
  and without obsession for performance, features or release frequency. It should
  boot instantly, consume little memory and offer an uncluttered graphical interface.
  The code should be easy to grasp (well, as long as you speak Haskell...) to encourage
  users to hack it. Simplicity provides lightness, scalability, stability and maintainability.\n\nExtensible\n
  \ Users should be able to implement extra features through an extension system,
  without digging into the internals of the application. External programs should
  be able to query/command the web browser.\n\nGood defaults\n  The default behavior
  should be suitable for users that cannot afford or don't want to spend (waste ?)
  their time in tweaks.\n\nKeyboard driven\n  Keyboard control should be made as much
  convenient, with as little mouse intervention, as possible.\n\n\nComponents and
  libraries used\n-----------------------------\n\nProgramming language : Haskell_\n
  \ Modern, purely-functional language that makes it possible to work with a concise,
  elegant and robust code.\n\nLayout engine : WebKit_\n  Has to be open-source, be
  (kind of) standards-compliant, and provide a Haskell binding. Considering those
  requirements, WebKit is pretty much the only game in town.\n\nHTTP client : WebKit_\n
  \ Ideally, the HTTP client should be delegated to a distinct library (typically
  http-conduit_), but WebKit clearly wasn't designed to be used as a *mere* layout
  engine. So for now, it still handles all network connections.\n\nUI toolkit : `GTK+`_\n
  \ Given the programming language and layout engine, there's no much choice left
  for the UI toolkit.\n\nInterprocess interface : ZeroMQ_\n  Socket-like interface
  that implements various communication schemes like request-reply and publish-subscribe.\n\nConfiguration
  system : Dyre_\n  Dynamic reconfiguration library for haskell programs.\n\n\nSuggestions
  about better alternatives for any of these points (except the programming language)
  are welcome.\n\n\nInstallation notes\n------------------\n\nUp until GHC 7.8, *hbro*
  requires the *integer-simple* package, which means you won't be able to build it
  using a standard GHC installation that uses the *integer-gmp* package. This distinction
  is `documented here`_, and the reason for this constraint is `explained there`_.\n\nStarting
  with GHC 7.10, the *integer-gmp* package was completely rewritten and *integer-simple*
  is no longer required.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nBy default, a minimal
  configuration file (see ``Hbro/Main.hs``) is used to build *hbro*. You can create
  your own at ``~/.hbro/hbro.hs`` to override it. Several extensions are provided
  with the * hbro-contrib_ * package, including a commented configuration file example.\n\n\nGUI
  layout\n----------\n\nThe graphical layout is described in an XML file that is parsed
  by GtkBuilder_. This file is looked for in several places with the following order
  of priority:\n\n- the value from commandline option ``-U``;\n- the ``~/.hbro/ui.xml``
  file;\n- the ``examples/ui.xml`` file bundled with the package.\n\nAt least the
  following widgets must be defined, with the adequate ``id`` attributes, for the
  browser to start:\n\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| Type                  |
  ``id``                |\n+=======================+=======================+\n| ``GtkWindow``
  \        | ``mainWindow``        |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkVBox``           | ``windowBox``         |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkScrolledWindow`` | ``webViewParent``     |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkHBox``           | ``promptBox``         |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkLabel``          | ``promptDescription`` |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkEntry``          | ``promptEntry``       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkHBox``           | ``statusBox``         |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n|
  ``GtkLabel``          | ``notificationLabel`` |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n\n\nKnown
  bugs and limitations\n--------------------------\n\nMany problems/limitations are
  inherited from the *Haskell* bindings webkitgtk3_ and gtk3_. Until fixed in upstream,
  nothing can be done on *hbro* to work around them. Here's a summary of them:\n\n-
  **segmentation faults when loading some webpages while javascript/flash is enabled**;\n-
  vertical scrollbar cannot be hidden;\n- no proxy configuration;\n- no cookies management;\n-
  javascript's ``window.open`` requests open in the same window instead of spawning
  a new one;\n- toggling to source mode reloads current webpage (which may be undesired)\n\nPatches
  or suggestions to deal with these issues are welcome.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n*hbro*
