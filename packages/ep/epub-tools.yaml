synopsis: Command line utilities for working with epub files
changelog: ! "2.11 (2018-01-16)\n\n   * Switched license from BSD3 to ISC\n   * Fixes
  and additions to some epubname rules\n   * Fixed a couple of cabal file issues\n\n\n2.10
  (2017-12-24)\n\n   * Changed the Stackage resolver from a nightly to an lts\n   *
  Now using a less-fragile `Printf*` type signature\n   * Removed an unused GHC options
  compile directive\n   * Added a missing module to all other-modules stanzas\n   *
  Added a unit test for authors with a middle-name\n\n\n2.9 (2016-10-19)\n\n   * Switched
  build to stack\n   * Added hsinstall installation script and updated windows dist
  script\n   * Various cabal file updates\n   * Moved copyright date up to 2016\n
  \  * Updated README with better instructions for getting this software\n\n\n2.8
  (2015-09-18)\n\n   * Fixed some magazine and anthology naming rules\n\n\n2.7 (2015-05-29)\n\n
  \  * Added back Control.Applicative import for GHC 7.8 compatibility\n\n\n2.6 (2015-05-25)\n\n
  \  * Fixed an error in bad DSL command index reporting\n   * Replaced deprecated
  Control.Monad.Error with\n     Control.Monad.Except\n   * Replaced deprecated System.Cmd
  with System.Process\n   * Removed useless import of Control.Applicative\n   * Updated
  cabal homepage, tested-with and source-repository\n   * Removed unused path to rules
  file in unit tests\n   * Reformatted TODO and development notes into Markdown documents\n
  \  * Updated boringfile with cabal sandbox filespecs\n   * Switched over to using
  Data.Version instead of hard-coded\n     version string\n\n\n2.5 (2014-04-04)\n\n
  \  * Additions and modifications to the stock rules to both support\n     more books
  and also use more generic rules than before\n   * Added code to set proper case
  for Roman numerals in titles\n   * Added code to handle file-as names with parenthesized
  name info\n   * Simplified and consolidated special-character filtering code\n   *
  Added support for multiline fields in the Metadata\n\n\n2.4 (2014-03-19)\n\n   *
  Fixed problem in Windows cmd shell with missing UNIX HOME\n     env variable\n   *
  Now gracefully handling last-name-first creators. For books\n     with no file-as
  and the Creator text arranged last-name-first\n     with a comma, do the right thing.\n
  \  * Added a new rule for generically-titled magazines with an issue\n   * Incorporated
  project website info into README.md and\n     changelog.md files. This information
  is now in source control\n     where it belongs.\n   * Added missing files to .cabal
  for sdist\n   * Changed copyright date range to 2014\n\n\n2.3 (2013-09-20)\n\n   *
  These tools now support both epub2 and epub3\n   * Documentation changes and additions\n\n\n2.2
  (2013-04-14)\n\n   * Updated to build against recent changes and bug fixes in\n
  \    epub-metadata 3.0\n   * All support data files have been brought into the binaries\n
  \    now. This makes these tools more tolerant to being moved to a\n     different
  location than what they were configured for build with.\n   * Some documentation
  additions and changes\n\n\n2.1.1 (2013-02-03)\n\n   * Fixed a stack overflow problem
  with some epub documents\n\n\n2.1.0 (2013-02-01)\n\n   * Added new subjectMatch
  command to the DSL, similar to\n     authorMatch. This is being primarily used to
  detect anthology\n     publications.\n   * Removed some rules that are now handled
  by anthology detection,\n     and fixed relevant unit tests\n   * Clarified DSL
  documentation for authorMatch a little more\n   * Modified rules for some magazines
  to reflect changes to\n     recent editions\n   * Fixed an error in the DSL documentation\n
  \  * Fixed a bug in epubzip where no epub file will be created if\n     none already
  exists\n\n\n2.0.0 (2012-10-31)\n\n   * Major redesign of the formatting rules system.
  Renaming\n     machinery is now described in a domain-specific language,\n     NOT
  in statically compiled code. Users are able to extend the\n     functionality with
  custom naming rules in conf files.\n   * Added interactive mode to ask about each
  file rename as they\n     happen, this is like darcs now!\n   * Added ability to
  specify target directory for books to be\n     moved to as part of renaming. Includes
  code to check that target\n     directory exists.\n   * Removed --overwrite option.
  Turns out, renameFile has always\n     been smart enough to not overwrite existing.\n
  \  * Added / character to filters, a big no-no character for file\n     paths on
  most sane filesystems\n   * Publication year was looking for publication before\n
  \    original-publication, causing problems in books that have\n     both tags\n
  \  * Miscellaneous rules changes for various publications\n\n\n1.1.2 (2012-01-29)\n\n
  \  * Changed how this code provides epub zip file contents as a\n     ByteString
  to the epub-metadata library. Need to read this data\n     strictly to avoid dangling
  open files.\n   * Corrected for breakage due to change in title format of Eclipse
  magazine\n   * Some work done on the utility script for deploying Windows\n     binaries
  of these tools\n   * Added parsing support and test cases for more date formats\n
  \  * Minor usage info changes\n\n\n1.1.1 (2011-11-15)\n\n   * Changed how publication
  date is found to more closely follow\n     the OPF spec recommendations\n   * Changed
  the switches related to publication date\n   * Redesigned unit test code and added
  more tests for new date code\n\n\n1.1.0 (2011-11-04)\n\n   * Huge redesign of how
  formatting works, dramatically shortening\n     the code needed to handle any given
  book type. Code is much more\n     monadic now and consolidated into one module.\n
  \  * Many changes/additions to magazine and compilation book name\n     formatting\n
  \  * Fixed a group of bugs that occur when a creator has only a\n     single word
  for their name\n   * Extensive changes/additions to unit testing for above\n\n\n1.0.0.1
  (2011-10-27)\n\n   * Extensive changes to the cabal build of this project to bring\n
  \    it up to Cabal 1.10\n   * Unit tests now use the test-suite cabal stanza\n\n\n1.0.0.0
  (2011-04-23)\n\n   * Initial release\n"

description: ! "# epub-tools\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\nCommand line utilities for working
  with epub files (Haskell)\n\n\n## Description\n\nA suite of command-line utilities
  for creating and manipulating epub book files. Included are: epubmeta, epubname,
  epubzip. This software uses the epub-metadata library, also available on Hackage.\n\n###
  epubmeta\n\nepubmeta is a command-line utility for examining and editing epub book
  metadata. With it you can export, import and edit the raw OPF Package XML document
  for a given book. Or simply dump the metadata to stdout for viewing in a friendly
  format.\n\nHere's an example of epubmeta output:\n\n      $ epubmeta Kelly_Kessel_Lethem-NinetyPercentOfEverything.epub\n\n
  \     package\n         version: 2.0\n         unique-identifier: calibre_id\n      identifier\n
  \        id: calibre_id\n         scheme: calibre\n         text: b1026732-69a5-4a05-a8d9-a1701685f6fa\n
  \     identifier\n         scheme: ISBN\n         text: 1-590620-00-3\n      title:
  Ninety Percent of Everything\n      language: en-us\n      contributor\n         text:
  calibre (0.5.1) [http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net]\n         file-as: calibre\n         role:
  bkp\n      creator\n         text: James Patrick Kelly\n         file-as: Kelly,
  James Patrick\n         role: aut\n      creator\n         text: John Kessel\n         role:
  aut\n      creator\n         text: Jonathan Lethem\n         role: aut\n      date:

  Fiction/Fantasy\n\n### epubname\n\nepubname is a command-line utility for renaming
  epub ebook files based on their OPF Package metadata. It tries to use author names
  and title info to construct a sensible name.\n\nUsing it looks like this:\n\n      $
  epubname poorly-named-book.epub\n\n      poorly-named-book.epub -> WattsPeter-Blindsight_2006.epub\n\n
  \     $ epubname another-poorly-named-book.epub\n\n      another-poorly-named-book.epub
  -> Kelly_Kessel_Lethem-NinetyPercentOfEverything.epub\n\n### epubzip\n\nepubzip
  is a handy utility for zipping up the files that comprise an epub into an .epub
  zip file. Using the same technology as epubname, it can try to make a meaningful
  filename for the book.\n\n\n## Getting this software\n\nBinaries\n\n- epub-tools
  is available for Arch Linux [from the AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/epub-tools/)\n-
  Download [binaries for Windows](http://ui3.info/d/proj/epub-tools/epub-tools-2.10-win.zip)\n\n\nGetting
  source for development\n\n- Download the cabalized source package [from Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/epub-tools)\n-
  Get the source with git: `$ git clone https://github.com/dino-/epub-tools.git`\n-
  Get the source with stack: `$ stack unpack epub-tools`\n- If you're just looking,
  [browse the source](https://github.com/dino-/epub-tools)\n\n\nOnce you have source,
  building the usual way:\n\n      $ stack build\n      $ stack test\n      $ stack
