description: ! 'We have developed TerraHS, a software component that enables the development
  of geographical applications in a functional language, using the data handling capabilities
  of TerraLib. TerraLib is a C++ library that supports different spatial database
  management systems, and that includes a large number of spatial algorithms. As a
  result, we get a combination of the good features of both programming paradigms.
