description: ! 'HSML syntax is very similar to that of XML, but there are less rules.

  The main advantage over plain XML or HTML is that it allows you to embed Haskell
  declarations

  and expression directly into your template.

  The main advantage over something like Blaze is that it saves

  you the overhead of using Blaze''s combinators. It''s also relatively easy to port
  your existing

  plain HTML templates into HSML (most of the times, cut & paste will suffice).

  For examples, see the examples directory.'
