description: ! '

  An efficient packed, immutable UTF-8 backed Unicode text type (both strict and

  lazy), with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework.


  The ''Text'' type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and

  space-efficient manner. This package provides text processing

  capabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both

  in terms of large data quantities and high speed.


  The ''Text'' type provides character-encoding, type-safe case

  conversion via whole-string case conversion functions (see "Data.Text").

  It also provides a range of functions for converting ''Text'' values to

  and from ''ByteStrings'', using several standard encodings

  (see "Data.Text.Encoding").


  Efficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported

  (see "Data.Text.IO").


  These modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name

  clashes with Prelude functions, e.g.


  > import qualified Data.Text as T


  == Relationship to the standard text package


  This is a fork of the [text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text)

  package ported which uses UTF-8 instead of UTF-16 as its internal

  representation.


  This release is intended to be API compatible with the @text-1.2.3.0@ release.


  Another package providing an UTF-8 backed Text type with a diffferent cost-model

  is the [text-short](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-short) package.'
