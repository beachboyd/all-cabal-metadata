  Haskell Test Utility Pack for HUnit and QuickCheck testpack provides

  utilities for both HUnit and QuickCheck. These include tools for

  running QuickCheck properties as HUnit test cases, allowing you to

  combine both approaches in a single program. It also includes tools for

  more helpful displays of running progress in both HUnit and QuickCheck,

  additional generators for other types for QuickCheck, and shortcuts for

  quickly defining new test cases.'
