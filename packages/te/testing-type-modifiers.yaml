description: ! 'Property based testing libraries such as QuickCheck tend to include
  type modifiers. Most of them

  are used to quantify over subsets of a type. For example a property on non-empty
  lists:


  @  prop_tail_length (NonEmpty xs) = length (tail xs) == length xs - 1 @


  This library is intended to supply these modifiers to be used by testing libraries,
  in an effort to make

  properties more portable between testing frameworks.


  For every modifier it also provides an access function that converts to the underlying
  type, which

  enables point-free style properties as such:


  @

  prop_tail_length2 = (> 0) . length . nonEmpty

  @'
