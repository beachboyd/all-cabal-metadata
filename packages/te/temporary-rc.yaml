description: ! 'The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the
  base library are quite limited. The unixutils

  package contains some good ones, but they aren''t portable to Windows.

  This library just repackages the Cabal implementations of its own temporary file
  and folder functions so that

  you can use them without linking against Cabal or depending on it being installed.

  This is a better maintained fork of the "temporary" package.'
