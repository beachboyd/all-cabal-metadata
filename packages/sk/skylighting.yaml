changelog: ! "# Revision history for skylighting\n\n## 0.4.3 --- 2017-11-02\n\n  *
  `FormatOptions`: added `lineIdPrefix` (jgm/pandoc#4031).\n    This is needed because
  a web page may contain several\n    code samples, and we need to make sure that
  the ids on\n    lines are unique.\n  * HTML formatter: use `lineIdPrefix` in ids
  for lines.\n  * HTML formatter: Don't put href attributes on divs.\n\n## 0.4.2 ---
  2017-10-26\n\n  * HTML output: remove outer div.  This prevented margin\n    collapsing
  between the pre and surrounding block elements,\n    and often gave us excess white
  space around code blocks.\n    See jgm/pandoc#3996.\n\n## 0.4.1 --- 2017-09-28\n\n
  \ * Updated XML definitions from KDE repository.\n    Changed: actionscript, ada,
  agda, alert, alert_indent, asn1, awk, bash,\n    boo, c, changelog, clojure, cmake,
  coldfusion, commonlisp, cpp, cs, css,\n    curry, d, dockerfile, dot, doxygen, doxygenlua,
  eiffel, email, erlang,\n    fortran, fsharp, gcc, haskell, haxe, isocpp, java, javascript,
  jsp, julia,\n    lilypond, lua, m4, makefile, matlab, maxima, mips, modelines, modula-2,\n
  \   monobasic, objectivec, objectivecpp, ocaml, octave, opencl, pascal, perl,\n
  \   php, pike, postscript, prolog, purebasic, python, r, relaxng,\n    relaxngcompact,
  rest, rhtml, ruby, rust, scala, scheme, sci, sql-mysql,\n    sql-postgresql, sql,
  tcl, tcsh, verilog, vhdl, xml, xslt, xul, zsh.\n  * Added support for powershell,
  using definition from KDE repository.\n  * Stop terminating long builds on TravisCI
  (Kyle Ondy).\n\n## 0.4 --- 2017-09-15\n\n  * Removed ToJSON/FromJSON instances for
  KeywordAttr,\n    WordSet, Matcher, Context, ContextSwitch, Rule, Syntax\n    (added
  in 0.3.5).  Creating these increased the memory\n    requirements for compiling
  skylighting to a degree not\n    justified by the usefulness of these instances.\n\n##
  0.3.5 --- 2017-09-14\n\n  * Added ToJSON/FromJSON instances for all basic types.\n
  \ * Added some background colors to 'kate' style, matching default.theme,\n    and
  made FromJSON for Style sensitive to background-color.\n\n## 0.3.4.1 -- 2017-09-09\n\n
  \ * HTML formatting: do not use `div` elements for source\n    lines in inline output.\n\n##
  0.3.4 -- 2017-09-09\n\n  * HTML formatting changes (David Baynard).  Note that these\n
  \   changes may require changes in hard-coded CSS that is\n    used with skylighting's
  HTML output.\n\n    + Wrap lines of source code in a `div` with `display` set to\n
  \     `inline-block`.  The `div`s make per-line processing easier.\n      They cannot
  be set as `display: block` as that introduces extra\n      new lines when copying
  and pasting.\n    + Render line numbers in html using CSS pseudo elements rather
  than\n      a table.  The line numbers are always produced, as `data-line-number`\n
  \     attributes, and css to display them as `::before` elements are\n      always
  produced. The option to switch on line numbering only\n      toggles a class; this
  means it is possible to toggle line numbering\n      without re-running skylighting.\n
  \   + If the `linkAnchors` option is set, wrap with an `a` element rather\n      than
  a `div`, set so that clicking the line number (and only the\n      line number)
  will jump to that line.\n    + Code wraps by default when html is printed, with
  wrapped lines\n      indented.\n\n## 0.3.3.1 -- 2017-06-26\n\n  * Updated xml syntax
  definitions and clojure test.\n  * Improved 'make update-xml' target.\n  * Updated
  version bound for criterion.\n\n## 0.3.3 -- 2017-04-22\n\n  * Revert change from
  0.3.2; now entities from a DTD are\n    resolved if the DTD element is included.
  \ This is needed\n    for agda.xml and some others.  If you want to use a custom\n
  \   xml definition without needing language.dtd, just remove\n    the reference
  to language.dtd in your xml file.\n  * Added `case` keyword for ats (Hanwen (Steinway)
  Wu).\n\n## 0.3.2 -- 2017-04-01\n\n  * Parse xml definitions without resolving entities
  from\n    language.dtd.  This allows xml definitions to be used even\n    when language.dtd
  isn't available.  Existing definitions\n    don't rely on the two or three entities
  definied in\n    language.dtd, so this is harmless.\n  * Small optimizations.\n\n##
  0.3.1 -- 2017-02-28\n\n  * Use handwritten parser for Float instead of regex.  Fixes\n
  \   jgm/highlighting-kate#57 (again).\n  * Added float parsing tests.\n  * Use parsec
  parsers, not regex, for CStringChar and CChar.\n  * Rewrote Int, Hex, Oct, CStringChar,
  CCHar parsers with parsec\n    instead of regex.  This speeds things up.\n  * Don't
  include leading + in Int, Hex, Oct parsers.  That gives\n    bad results for things
  like `i+1`.\n\n## 0.3 -- 2017-02-19\n\n  * Store literal binary-encoded representations
  of the Syntax\n    structure in Skylighting.Syntax.*.hs, instead of the\n    structure
  itself.  This works around a problem ghc has\n    compiling modules with large structures.
  \ This indirect method\n    produces faster compile times and avoids massive memory
  usage by\n    ghc (especially in profiling builds).  For background see\n    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16348340/.
  \ Closes #7.\n  * Types: Internals of 'WordSet' are no longer exposed.\n\n## 0.2
  -- 2017-02-19\n\n  * Restore Data, Typeable, Generic instances for basic types.\n
  \   To do this, we remove reCompiled field from RE (API change).  Instead, we\n
  \   have the tokenizer compile regexes the first time it encounters them,\n    memoizing
  the results.  Performance is not significantly worse.\n  * Skylighting.Syntax.*:
  \ use string representation of the Syntax,\n    which is then 'read', rather than
  including the code for the data\n    structure directly (#7).  This indirect method
  produces faster compile\n    times and avoids massive memory usage by ghc (especially
  in profiling\n    builds).  For background see\n    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16348340/compiling-very-large-constants-with-ghc\n
  \ * Use -fprof-auto-exported for profiling builds.\n  * Added benchmark for xml
  syntax definition parsing.\n  * Patched perl.xml (improperly escaped regex) (#8).\n
  \   This fixes a perl regex compilation error for regex patterns\n    with backslash
  as delimiter, e.g. m\\a\\.\n  * Add a flag to build with system pcre (Felix Yan).\n\n##
  0.1.1.5  -- 2017-02-03\n\n  * Avoid depending on a PrintfArg instance for Text (#5).\n
  \   This isn't provided in some older versions of the text library.\n    This change
  should allow the package to build on older platforms.\n\n## 0.1.1.4  -- 2017-01-31\n\n
  \ * Properly escape characters in subDynamic.\n    This fixes a problem that caused
  failures with\n\n        echo -e \"s\\0b\\0c\" | skylighting -s perl\n\n  * More
  efficient rewrite of char escaping for regexes.\n\n## 0.1.1.3  -- 2017-01-29\n\n
  \ * Increase test timeout to 6s.\n  * Avoid double {{}} in latex macros.\n  * Fixed
  problem compiling Format.LaTeX on older ghc versions (7.8.3)\n    that can't take
  a Text as PrintfArg.\n\n## 0.1.1.2  -- 2017-01-28\n\n  * Added much more extensive
  testing to ensure that tokenizers\n    don't hang or drop input.\n  * Fixed some
  issues with line-end and fallthrough context\n    handling.\n  * Fixed a bug in
  WordDetect handling which caused it to drop\n    input (#2).\n\n## 0.1.1.1  -- 2017-01-21\n\n
  \ * Optimized.  Speed is now comparable to highlighting-kate\n    and often better.\n
  \ * Added benchmarks.\n\n## 0.1.1    -- 2017-01-19\n\n  * Added breezeDark style,
  from breeze-dark.theme.\n  * Fixed performance bug in regex application (#1).  This
  gives a\n    significant speedup, especially for inputs with long lines.\n\n## 0.1.0.1
  \ -- 2016-12-23\n\n  * Fixed bug in LaTeX renderer (backslash in wrong position).\n\n##
  0.1.0.0  -- 2016-12-23\n\n  * Initial release\n\n"

description: ! "skylighting\n===========\n\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv2+-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\n[![travis
  build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jgm/skylighting.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jgm/skylighting)\n\nA
  Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived\nfrom KDE XML syntax
  highlighting descriptions.\n\nA command-line highlighter, `skylighting`, is also
  provided.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis library is the successor to [highlighting-kate],
  which had\nsome problems that were difficult to resolve given its\narchitecture.\n\nIn
  highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were converted\ninto individual parsec
  parsers, which were then compiled.  This\nmade it difficult to handle IncludeRules
  properly without\ncircular imports.  There was also no way to load a syntax\ndescription
  dynamically.\n\nSkylighting, by contrast, parses the XML syntax descriptions\ninto
  Haskell data structures, which are then interpreted by\na \"tokenize\" function.
  \ IncludeRules can now be handled\nproperly, and users can add new syntax descriptions\ndynamically.
  \ It is also now possible to convert `.theme` files\ndirectly into styles.\n\nSkylighting
  is also faster than highlighting-kate, by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo
  install the latest release from Hackage, do\n\n    stack install skylighting\nor\n\n
  \   cabal install skylighting\n\nIf you want the command-line tool, set the `executable`
  flag\nusing `--flag \"skylighting:executable\"` in stack or\n`-fexecutable` in cabal.\n\nThe
  release tarballs include generated files not present in this\nrepository.  Building
  from this repository is a two-step\nprocess.  In the first step we build a program,\n`skylighting-extract`,
  which reads XML syntax highlighting\ndefinitions from the `xml` directory and writes
  Haskell source\nfiles.  In the second we actually build the library.\n\nUsing stack:\n\n
  \   make bootstrap\n    make\n\nUsing cabal:\n\n    cabal install -fbootstrap --disable-optimizations\n
  \   cabal run skylighting-extract -- xml/*.xml\n    cabal install -f-bootstrap --disable-optimizations\n\nCommand-line
  tool\n-----------------\n\nA command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed
  if\nthe `executable` cabal flag is set in building.\n\nFor help, `skylighting --help`.\n\nAdding
  new syntaxes\n-------------------\n\nTo compile with additional syntaxes, simply
  add the syntax\ndefinition (XML) file to the `xml` directory and repeat the\nbootstrap
  build described above.\n\nNote that both the library and the executable can dynamically\nload
  syntax definitions, so you may not need to compile them\nin.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSkylighting
  is licensed under the GPL, because some of the xml\nsyntax descriptions from which
  its tokenizers are generated are\nGPL-licensed.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nKate
