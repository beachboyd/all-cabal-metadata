  |\n\nA Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived\nfrom KDE XML
  syntax highlighting descriptions.\n\nA command-line highlighter program, `skylighting`,
  is also provided.\n\nThis project is divided up into two packages:\n\n * `skylighting-core`:
  this provides KDE XML parsing, data types,\n   and output formatters. This includes
  the core functionality of the\n   skylighting project licensed under the BSD3 license,
  along with the\n   KDE XML files, some of which are licensed under the LGPL or GPL.
  This\n   package does not provide any built-in parsers corresponding to the\n   XML
  descriptions, however. For that, use `skylighting`.\n * `skylighting`: this exposes
  the `skylighting-core` API but also\n   provides bundled Haskell parser modules
  derived from the XML\n   descriptions in the `core` package. This package is entirely
  licensed\n   under the GPL.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis library is the successor
  to [highlighting-kate], which had\nsome problems that were difficult to resolve
  given its\narchitecture.\n\nIn highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were
  converted\ninto individual parsec parsers, which were then compiled.  This\nmade
  it difficult to handle IncludeRules properly without\ncircular imports.  There was
  also no way to load a syntax\ndescription dynamically.\n\nSkylighting, by contrast,
  parses the XML syntax descriptions\ninto Haskell data structures, which are then
  interpreted by\na \"tokenize\" function.  IncludeRules can now be handled\nproperly,
  and users can add new syntax descriptions\ndynamically.  It is also now possible
  to convert `.theme` files\ndirectly into styles.\n\nSkylighting is also faster than
  highlighting-kate, by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo
  install the latest release from Hackage, do\n\n    stack install skylighting\nor\n\n
  \   cabal install skylighting\n\nIf you want the command-line tool, set the `executable`
  flag\nusing `--flag \"skylighting:executable\"` in stack or\n`-fexecutable` in cabal.\n\nThe
  release tarball for the `skylighting` package includes generated\nfiles not present
  in this repository. Building from this repository is\na two-step process. In the
  first step we build the `skylighting-core`\npackage, which provides a program, `skylighting-extract`,
  which reads\nXML syntax highlighting definitions from the `xml` directory and writes\nHaskell
  source files. In the second we actually build the `skylighting`\npackage.\n\nUsing
  cabal:\n\n    cabal install -fexecutable\n    # or stack install --flag skylighting-core:executable\n
  \   cd skylighting\n    skylighting-extract /path/to/skylighting-core/xml/*.xml\n
  \   cabal install -fexecutable\n    # or stack install --flag skylighting:executable\n\nCommand-line
  tool\n-----------------\n\nA command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed
  if\nthe `executable` cabal flag is set in building.\n\nFor help, `skylighting --help`.\n\nAdding
  new syntaxes\n-------------------\n\nTo compile with additional syntaxes, simply
  add the syntax definition\n(XML) file to the `xml` directory of the `skylighting-core`
  package and\nrepeat the bootstrap build described above.\n\nNote that both the library
  and the executable can dynamically load\nsyntax definitions, so you may not need
  to compile them in. If you\nprefer this approach, you can use the `skylighting-core`
  package\ndirectly which provides the XML files without the generated code\nproduced
  by the bootstrap process described above.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe `skylighting`
  package is licensed under the GPL because some of the\nXML syntax descriptions from
  which its tokenizers are generated are\nGPL-licensed. However, the `skylighting-core`
  package, which provides\nthe core types and functions of this project is licensed
  under the BSD3\nlicense and bundles the GPL-licensed XML files separately.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nKate
