description: ! "Barley - A seed for learning Haskell\n====================================\n\nBarley
  is an environment for tinkering with [Haskell][1]. It is a web server\nwith an embedded
  simple programming environment rendered as web pages.\nThe environment allows you
  to easily edit Haskell code and quickly see the\nresult of running it.\n\nBarley
  includes a tutorial aimed at people with some programming and web\nexperience, but
  it assumes no exposure to Haskell or functional programming.\nThe tutorial takes
  the developer from generating a simple web page through\na modest web application
  with database backend storage. Along the way it\nexposes the programmer to the basic
  idioms needed to do simple programming\ntasks.\n\nBarley is based on the [Snap framework][2]
  for creating web programming in\nHaskell. Barley adds a simple web application skeleton
  to support both the\nlive development environment and the tutorial projects. After
  going through\nthe tutorial, developers can use Barley to create and explore their
  own\nsimple web projects. Beyond that, they can smoothly transition to using the\nwhole
  Snap framework and the wealth of available Haskell libraries.\n\n[1]: http://www.haskell.org/\n[2]:
  http://snapframework.com/\n\nStatus\n======\n\nThis is in the *very early concept
  stage*. We aren't even at a 0.1 release!\nRead this code at your own risk!\n\nDevelopers\n----------\n\nBarley
  was conceived during a flurry of Nepalese food by [Johan Tibell][jt]\nand [Mark
  Lentczner][ml]. We got immediate encouragement from others 'round\nthe table and
  spent the rest of the night plotting, and in Johan's case coding.\nThe next morning
  we found ourselves in a coffee house with other Haskellers\ncheering us on as we
  knocked off the first coding tasks.\n\n[jt]: http://github.com/tibbe\n[ml]: http://github.com/mtnviewmark\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nIf
  you can't hold back and download this code, you can run it like so:\n\n    cabal
  configure\n    cabal build\n    ghci -isrc:dist/build/autogen src/Main.hs\n    >
  :main start playground\n\nNote:\n\n* `start` = initialize a new project if needed,
  then run barley on it.\n* `playground` is just the name of a project directory,
  barley will create\n  it if needed.\n* If you don't `cabal install` barley, then
  it won't have access to its\n  data directory unless you start it from the root
  of the dev. tree.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright 2010 Google Inc.\n\nLicensed
