  # Revision history for base64

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-01-05

  * After a discussion with phadej, we're doing away with the flags, and splitting the optics out into their own separate library
  * Removed unnecessary inline pragmas

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-01-05

  * Do away with the typeclasses, and just provide prisms + synonyms
  * Continued performance improvements to decoding
  * Corrected benchmarks

  ## 0.0.1.0 -- 2020-01-03

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
  * Preliminary release

  # Base64

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/emilypi/base64.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/emilypi/base64)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/base64.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base64)

  Padded and unpadded base64 and base64url encodings for `Text` and `ByteString` values, along with their optics.


  ### Summary

  What does this library provide? Here is the summary:

  - Better performance over existing Base64 libraries (2x and 3x for most use-cases - see [PERFORMANCE.md](benchmarks/PERFORMANCE.md))
  - Support for unpadded Base64 and Base64-url
  - Support for `Text` encodings and decodings
  - Optics for handling more complex structures with Base64 representations via the `base64-lens` package

  There are no dependencies aside from `base`:

  ### Motivation

  Haskell has two main libraries for Base64: `memory`, and `base64-bytestring`.

  Of these, `memory` is geared towards integration with other memory primitives in the library, without much of an eye towards performance, while `base64-bytestring` is built to exclusively address `ByteString` encoding and decoding, and is very performant. Many great strides have been made in the realm of Base64 performance and vectorization just in the past 5 years, which this library attempts to capture. Additionally, we attempt to fix percieved shortcomings with both APIs in the support of unpadded Base64 and Base64-url support (which `memory` provides, but not `base64-bytestring`), as well as supporting `Text` values (neither libraries provide).
