changelog: ! "# Changelog for barbies\n\n## 0.1.4.0\n  - Add btraverse_\n  - Add the
  trivial Void and Unit barbies\n\n## 0.1.3.1\n  - Fix issue on Barbie-types with
  strictness annotations.\n\n## 0.1.3.0\n  - Use both `Monoid` and `Semigroup` as
  constraints for the `Monoid` instance,\n    so that this works with ghc 8.0 to 8.4
  (Fraser Murray)\n\n## 0.1.2.0\n  - Use `Monoid` and not `Semigroup` as constraints
  for the `Monoid` instance\n\n## 0.1.1.0\n  - Add `instance Semigroup (Barbie b)`
  to go along the `Monoid` instance\n\n## 0.1.0.1\n  - Works under GHC 8.0.2, but
  notice one needs to use empty instance\n    declarations, because ghc chokes on
  `deriving` clauses.\n\n\n## 0.1.0.0 - Initial release\n"

description: ! "# barbies [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcpetruzza/barbies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcpetruzza/barbies)\n\nTypes
  that are parametric on unary type-constructors that control\ntheir shapes are like
  Barbies that can wear different clothes\nto become a different doll. This is a common
  Haskell-idiom. E.g.,\n\n```haskell\n\ndata Barbie f\n  = Barbie\n      { name ::
  f String\n      , age  :: f Int\n      }\n\nb1 :: Barbie Last       -- Barbie with
  a monoid structure\nb2 :: Barbie (Const a)  -- container Barbie\nb3 :: Barbie Identity
  \  -- Barbie's new clothes\n\n```\n\nThis package provides basic classes and abstractions
  to work with these types and easily transform them.\n"
