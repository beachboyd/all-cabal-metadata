changelog: ! "Changelog\n=========\n\nVersion 0.2.2.0\n---------------\n\n*May 12,
  2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.2.2.0>\n\n*   `evalBP0`
  added, for convenience for no-argument values that need to be\n    evaluated without
  backpropagation.\n*   `splitBV` and `joinBV` for \"higher-kinded data\" style `BVar`
  manipulation,\n    via the `BVGroup` helper typeclass.\n*   `toList`, `mapAccumL`,
  and `mapAccumR` for *Prelude.Backprop* modules\n*   `Backprop` instance for `BVar`\n*
  \  *COMPLETE* pragmas for `T2` and `T3`\n*   Un-exported `gzero`, `gadd`, and `gone`
  from *Numeric.Backprop.Class*\n*   Many, many more instances of `Backprop`\n*   `Backprop`
  instance for `Proxy` made non-strict for `add`\n*   Swapped type variable order
  for a few library functions, which might\n    potentially be breaking changes.\n\n*Internal*\n\n*
  \  Fixed documentation for Num and Explicit Prelude modules, and rewrote\n    normal
  and Num Prelude modules in terms of canonical Prelude definitions\n*   Switched
  to `errorWithoutStackTrace` wherever appropriate (in *Internal*\n    module)\n\nVersion
  0.2.1.0\n---------------\n\n*May 8, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.2.1.0>\n\n*
  \  Added `ABP` newtype wrapper to *Numeric.Backprop.Class* (re-exported from\n    *Numeric.Backprop*
  and *Numeric.Backprop.Explicit*) to give free `Backprop`\n    instances for Applicative
  actions.\n*   Added `NumBP` newtype wrapper to *Numeric.Backprop.Class* (re-exported
  in\n    the same places as `ABP`) to give free `Backprop` instances for `Num`\n
  \   instances.\n*   Added `^^?!` (unsafe access) to *Numeric.Backprop* and\n    *Numeric.Backprop.Num*.\n*
  \  `Backprop` instance for `Natural` from *Numeric.Natural*.  Should actually\n
  \   be safe, unlike its `Num` instance!\n*   `zfFunctor` and `ofFunctor` for instances
  of `Functor` for\n    *Numeric.Backprop.Explicit*.\n*   `realToFrac` and `fromIntegral`
  to *Prelude* modules\n*   `T2` and `T3` patterns for *Numeric.Backprop*, for conveniently\n
  \   constructing and deconstructing tuples.\n\nVersion 0.2.0.0\n---------------\n\n*May
  1, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.2.0.0>\n\n*   Added
  `Backprop` class in *Numeric.Backprop.Class*, which is a typeclass\n    specifically
  for \"backpropagatable\" values.  This will replace `Num`.\n*   API of *Numeric.Backprop*
  completely re-written to require values be\n    instances of `Backprop` instead
  of `Num`.  This closes some outstanding\n    issues with the reliance of `Num`,
  and allows backpropagation to work with\n    non-Num instances like variable-length
  vectors, matrices, lists, tuples,\n    etc. (including types from *accelerate*)\n*
  \  *Numeric.Backprop.Num* and *Prelude.Backprop.Num* modules added, providing\n
  \   the old interface that uses `Num` instances instead of `Backprop`\n    instances,
  for those who wish to avoid writing orphan instances when\n    working with external
  types.\n*   *Numeric.Backprop.Explicit* and *Prelude.Backprop.Explicit* modules
  added,\n    providing an interface that allows users to manually specify how zeroing,\n
  \   addition, and one-ing works on a per-value basis.  Useful for those who\n    wish
  to avoid writing orphan instances of `Backprop` for types with no\n    `Num` instances,
  or if you are mixing and matching styles.\n*   `backpropWith` variants added, allowing
  you to specify a \"final gradient\",\n    instead of assuming it to be 1.\n*   Added
  `auto`, a shorter alias for `constVar` inspired by the *ad* library.\n*   *Numeric.Backprop.Tuple*
  module removed.  I couldn't find a significant\n    reason to keep it now that `Num`
  is no longer required for backpropagation.\n\n\nVersion 0.1.5.2\n---------------\n\n*Apr
  26, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.5.2>\n\n*   Added
  `coerceVar` to *Numeric.Backprop*\n*   Added `Random` instaces for all tuple types.
  \ Same as for `Binary`, this\n    does incur a *random* and *time* dependency only
  from the tuple types.\n    Again, because these packages are a part of GHC's boot
  libraries, this\n    is hopefully not too bad.\n\nVersion 0.1.5.1\n---------------\n\n*Apr
  9, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.5.1>\n\n*   Fixed
  `NFData` instance for `T`; before, was shallow.\n*   Added `Typeable` instances
  for all tuple types, and for `BVar`.\n*   Added `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, etc. instances
  for `T`.\n*   Added `Binary` instances for all tuple types.  Note that this does
  incur a\n    *binary* dependency only because of the tuple types; however, this
  will\n    hopefully be not too much of an issue because *binary* is a GHC library\n
  \   anyway.\n\nVersion 0.1.5.0\n---------------\n\n*Mar 30, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.5.0>\n\n*
  \  `T` added to *Numeric.Backprop.Tuple*: basically an `HList` with a `Num`\n    instance.\n*
  \  `Eq` and `Ord` instances for `BVar`.  Is this sound?\n\n*Internal*\n\n*   Refactored
  `Monoid` instances in *Numeric.Backprop.Tuple*\n\nVersion 0.1.4.0\n---------------\n\n*Mar
  25, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.4.0>\n\n*   `isoVar`,
  `isoVar2`, `isoVar3`, and `isoVarN`: convenient aliases for\n    applying isomorphisms
  to `BVar`s.  Helpful for use with constructors and\n    deconstructors.\n*   `opIso2`
  and `opIso3` added to *Numeric.Backprop.Op*, for convenience.\n*   `T0` (Unit with
  numeric instances) added to *Numeric.Backprop.Tuple*.\n\n*Internal*\n\n*   Completely
  decoupled the internal implementation from `Num`, which showed\n    some performance
  benefits.  Mostly just to make the code slightly cleaner,\n    and to prepare for
  some day potentially decoupling the external API from\n    `Num` as well.\n\nVersion
  0.1.3.0\n---------------\n\n*Feb 12, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.3.0>\n\n*
  \  *Preulude.Backprop* module added with lifted versions of several *Prelude*\n
  \   and base functions.\n*   `liftOpX` family of operators now have a more logical
  ordering for type\n    variables.  This change breaks backwards-compatibility.\n*
  \  `opIsoN` added to export list of *Numeric.Backprop*\n*   `noGrad` and `noGrad1`
  added to *Numeric.Backprop.Op*, for functions with\n    no defined gradient.\n\n*Internal*\n\n*
  \  Completely decoupled the internal implementation from `Num`, which showed\n    some
  performance benefits.\n\nVersion 0.1.2.0\n---------------\n\n*Feb 7, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.2.0>\n\n*
  \  Added currying and uncurrying functions for tuples in\n    *Numeric.Backprop.Tuple*.\n*
  \  `opIsoN`, for isomorphisms between a tuple of values and a value.\n*   (Internal)
  AD engine now using `Any` from *ghc-prim* instead of `Some I`\n    from *type-combinators*\n\nVersion
  0.1.1.0\n---------------\n\n*Feb 6, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.1.0>\n\n*
  \  Added canonical strict tuple types with `Num` instances, in the module\n    *Numeric.Backprop.Tuple*.
  \ This is meant to be a band-aid for the problem\n    of orphan instances and potential
  mismatched tuple types.\n*   Fixed bug in `collectVar` that occurs if container
  sizes change\n\n*Internal*\n\n*   Internal tweaks to the underlying automatic differentiation
  types that\n    decouple backpropagation from `Num`, internally.  `Num` is now just
  used\n    externally as a part of the API, which might someday be made optional.\n\nVersion
  0.1.0.0\n---------------\n\n*Feb 5, 2018*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.1.0.0>\n\n*
  \  First non-alpha release.\n*   More or less complete redesign of library.  The
  entire API is completely\n    changed, and there is no backwards compatibility!\n
  \   *   Everything is now \"implicit\" style, and there is no more `BP` monad.\n
  \   *   Accessing items in `BVar`s is now lens-, prism-, and traversal- based,\n
  \       instead of iso- and generics-based.\n    *   `Op` is no longer monadic\n
  \   *   *Mono* modules are removed.\n    *   *Implicit* modules are removed, since
  they are the default\n    *   *Iso* module is removed, since `Iso`s no longer play
  major role in the\n        implementation of the library.\n*   Removed dependency
  on *ad* and *ad*-based ops, which had been pulling in\n    the vast majority of
  dependencies.\n*   Moved from *.cabal* file to *hpack* system.\n\nVersion 0.0.3.0\n---------------\n\n*Alpha*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.0.3.0>\n\n*
  \  Removed samples as registered executables in the cabal file, to reduce\n    dependences
  to a bare minimum.  For convenience, build script now also\n    compiles the samples
  into the local directory if *stack* is installed.\n\n*   Added experimental (unsafe)
  combinators for working with GADTs with\n    existential types, `withGADT`, to *Numeric.Backprop*
  module.\n\n*   Fixed broken links in changelog.\n\nVersion 0.0.2.0\n---------------\n\n*Alpha*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.0.2.0>\n\n*
  \  Added optimized numeric `Op`s, and re-write `Num`/`Fractional`/`Floating`\n    instances
  in terms of them.\n\n*   Removed all traces of `Summer`/`Unity` from the library,
  eliminating a\n    whole swath of \"explicit-Summer\"/\"explicit-Unity\" versions
  of functions.\n    As a consequence, the library now only works with `Num` instances.
  \ The\n    API, however, is now much more simple.\n\n*   Benchmark suite added for
  MNIST example.\n\nVersion 0.0.1.0\n---------------\n\n*Alpha*\n\n<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.0.1.0>\n\n*
  \  Initial pre-release, as a request for comments.  API is in a usable form\n    and
  everything is fully documented, but there are definitely some things\n    left to
  be done. (See [README.md][readme-0.0.1.0])\n\n    [readme-0.0.1.0]: https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/tree/v0.0.1.0#readme\n\n"

  which can be built (if [stack][] is\ninstalled) using:\n\n[mnist-lhs]: https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/blob/master/samples/backprop-mnist.lhs\n[mnist-pdf]:

  http://haskellstack.org/\n\n```bash\n$ ./Build.hs exe\n```\n\nThere is a follow-up
  tutorial on using the library with more advanced types,\nwith extensible neural
  networks a la [this blog post][blog], [available as\nliterate haskell][neural-lhs]
  and also [rendered as a PDF][neural-pdf].\n\n[blog]: https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+practical-dependent-types-in-haskell.html\n[neural-lhs]:
  https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/blob/master/samples/extensible-neural.lhs\n[neural-pdf]:
  https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/blob/master/renders/extensible-neural.pdf\n\nBrief
  example\n-------------\n\n(This is a really brief version of my [blog post][blog])\n\nThe
  quick example below describes the running of a neural network with one\nhidden layer
  to calculate its squared error with respect to target `targ`,\nwhich is parameterized
  by two weight matrices and two bias vectors.\nVector/matrix types are from the *hmatrix*
  package.\n\nLet's make a data type to store our parameters, with convenient accessors
  using\n*[lens][]*:\n\n[lens]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Network i h o = Net { _weight1 :: L h i\n                         , _bias1   ::
  R h\n                         , _weight2 :: L o h\n                         , _bias2
  \  :: R o\n                         }\n\nmakeLenses ''Network\n```\n\nNormally,
  we might write code to \"run\" a neural network on an input like this:\n\n```haskell\nneuralNet\n
  \   :: R i\n    -> Network i h o\n    -> R h\nneuralNet x n = z\n  where\n    y
  = logistic $ (n ^. weight1) #> x + (n ^. bias1)\n    z = logistic $ (n ^. weight2)
  #> y + (n ^. bias2)\n\nlogistic :: Floating a => a -> a\nlogistic x = 1 / (1 + exp
  (-x))\n```\n\n(`R i` is an i-length vector, `L h i` is an h-by-i matrix, etc., `#>`
  is\nmatrix-vector multiplication, and `^.` is access to a field via lens.)\n\nWhen
  given an input vector and the network, we compute the result of the neural\nnetwork
  ran on the input vector.\n\nWe can write it, instead, using *backprop*:\n\n```haskell\nneuralNet\n
  \   :: Reifies s W\n    => BVar s (R i)\n    -> BVar s (Network i h o)\n    -> BVar
  s (R o)\nneuralNet x n = z\n  where\n    y = logistic $ (n ^^. weight1) #> x + (n
  ^^. bias1)\n    z = logistic $ (n ^^. weight2) #> y + (n ^^. bias2)\n\nlogistic
  :: Floating a => a -> a\nlogistic x = 1 / (1 + exp (-x))\n```\n\n(`#>!` is a backprop-aware
  version of `#>`, and `^^.` is access to a field via\nlens in a `BVar`)\n\nAnd that's
  it!  `neuralNet` is now backpropagatable!\n\nWe can \"run\" it using `evalBP`:\n\n```haskell\nevalBP
  (neuralNet (constVar x)) :: Network i h o -> R o\n```\n\nAnd we can find the gradient
  using `gradBP`:\n\n```haskell\ngradBP (neuralNet (constVar x)) :: Network i h o
  -> Network i h o\n```\n\nIf we write a function to compute errors:\n\n```haskell\nnetError\n
  \   :: Reifies s W\n    => BVar s (R i)\n    -> BVar s (R o)\n    -> BVar s (Network
  i h o)\n    -> BVar s Double\nnetError x targ n = norm_2 (neuralNet x - t)\n```\n\n(`norm_2`
  is a backprop-aware euclidean norm)\n\nNow, we can perform gradient descent!\n\n```haskell\ngradDescent\n
  \   :: R i\n    -> R o\n    -> Network i h o\n    -> Network i h o\ngradDescent
  x targ n0 = n0 - 0.1 * gradient\n  where\n    gradient = gradBP (netError (constVar
  x) (constVar targ)) n0\n```\n\nTa dah!  We were able to compute the gradient of
  our error function, just by\nonly saying how to compute *the error itself*.\n\nFor
  a more fleshed out example, see my [blog post][blog] and the [MNIST\ntutorial][mnist-lhs]
  (also [rendered as a pdf][mnist-pdf])\n\nLens Access\n-----------\n\nA lot of the
  friction of dealing with `BVar s a`s instead of `a`s directly is\nalleviated with
  the lens interface.\n\nWith a lens, you can \"view\" and \"set\" items inside a
  `BVar`, as if they were\nthe actual values:\n\n```haskell\n(^.)  ::        a ->
  Lens' a b ->        b\n(^^.) :: BVar s a -> Lens' a b -> BVar s b\n\n(.~)  :: Lens'
  a b ->        b ->        a ->        a\n(.~~) :: Lens' a b -> BVar s b -> BVar
  s a -> BVar s a\n```\n\nAnd you can also extract multiple potential targets, as
  well, using\n`Traversal`s and `Prism`s:\n\n```haskell\n-- | Actually takes a Traversal,
  to be more general.\n-- Can be used to implement \"pattern matching\" on BVars\n(^?)
  \ ::        a -> Prism' a b -> Maybe (       b)\n(^^?) :: BVar s a -> Prism' a b
  -> Maybe (BVar s b)\n\n(^..)  ::        a -> Traversal' a b -> [       b]\n(^^..)
  :: BVar s a -> Traversal' a b -> [BVar s b]\n```\n\nNote that the library itself
  has no *lens* dependency, using *[microlens][]*\ninstead.\n\n[microlens]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\n\nHere
  are some basic benchmarks comparing the library's automatic\ndifferentiation process
  to \"manual\" differentiation by hand.  When using the\n[MNIST tutorial][bench]
  as an example:\n\n[bench]: https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/blob/master/bench/MNISTBench.hs\n\n![benchmarks](https://i.imgur.com/9DXUaOI.png)\n\n*
  \  For computing the gradient, there is about a 2.5ms overhead (or about 3.5x)\n
  \   compared to computing the gradients by hand.  Some more profiling and\n    investigation
  can be done, since there are two main sources of potential\n    slow-downs:\n\n
  \   1.  \"Inefficient\" gradient computations, because of automated\n        differentiation
  not being as efficient as what you might get from doing\n        things by hand
  and simplifying.  This sort of cost is probably not\n        avoidable.\n    2.
  \ Overhead incurred by the book-keeping and actual automatic\n        differentiating
  system, which involves keeping track of a dependency\n        graph and propagating
  gradients backwards in memory.  This sort of\n        overhead is what we would
  be aiming to reduce.\n\n    It is unclear which one dominates the current slowdown.\n\n*
  \  However, it may be worth noting that this isn't necessarily a significant\n    bottleneck.
  \ *Updating* the networks using *hmatrix* actually dominates the\n    runtime of
  the training.  Manual gradient descent takes 3.2ms, so the extra\n    overhead is
  about 60%-70%.\n\n*   Running the network (and the backprop-aware functions) incurs
  virtually\n    zero overhead (about 4%), meaning that library authors could actually\n
  \   export backprop-aware functions by default and not lose any performance.\n\nTodo\n----\n\n1.
  \ Benchmark against competing back-propagation libraries like *ad*, and\n    auto-differentiating
  tensor libraries like *[grenade][]*\n\n    [grenade]: https://github.com/HuwCampbell/grenade\n\n2.
  \ Write tests!\n\n3.  Explore opportunities for parallelization.  There are some
  naive ways of\n    directly parallelizing right now, but potential overhead should
  be\n    investigated.\n\n4.  Some open questions:\n\n    a.  Is it possible to support
  constructors with existential types?\n\n    b.  How to support \"monadic\" operations
  that depend on results of previous\n        operations? (`ApBP` already exists for
  situations that don't)\n"
