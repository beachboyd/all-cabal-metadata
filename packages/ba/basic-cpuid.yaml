description: ! 'Similar to the cpuid package this package allows one to

  call the CPUID instruction from plain Haskell. In contrast

  to the cpuid package it is very minimalistic and provides

  no additional helper functions. On the other side it is

  possible to build this package on every platform. If the

  platform does not support the CPUID instruction, calling

  it from Haskell will just throw an exception.'
