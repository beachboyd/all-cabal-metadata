description: ! 'Provides QuickCheck implementations for common types distributed

  with GHC and in the Haskell Platform.  The implementations

  are NOT provided through the QuickCheck Arbitrary and

  CoArbitrary typeclasses; instead, they are provided through

  ordinary, non-overloaded functions.  This avoids problems

  with orphan instances.


  Implementations are provided through child modules of the

  module that provides the original type.  For example, for

  "Data.Map", look under "Data.Map.Generators",

  "Data.Map.Shrinkers", and "Data.Map.Coarbitrary".

  For instance, a function that generates a Map is at

  ''Data.Map.Generators.map'', while a function providing

  a coarbitrary implementation is at ''Data.Map.Coarbitrary.map''.

  Obviously this can lead to name conflicts, both between

  modules provided in this package and with other standard

  modules, so keep this in mind when you do your imports.'
