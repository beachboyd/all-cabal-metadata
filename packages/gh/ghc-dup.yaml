description: ! 'This package provides two new operations, ''GHC.Dup.dup'' and ''GHC.Dup.deepDup'',
  that allow the

  programmer to prevent the result of two evaluations of the same expression to

  be shared.


  See <http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2017> for more background.


  /This is still experimental software and can likely cause your program to crash./
