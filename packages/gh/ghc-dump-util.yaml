description: ! '@ghc-dump@ is a library, GHC plugin, and set of tools for recording
  and

  analysing GHC''s Core representation. The plugin is compatible with GHC 7.10

  through 8.3, exporting a consistent (albeit somewhat lossy) representation

  across these versions. The AST is encoded as CBOR, which is small and easy to

  deserialise.


  This package provides the AST and compiler plugin. See the @ghc-dump-util@

  package for a useful command-line tool for working with dumps produced by this

  plugin.'
