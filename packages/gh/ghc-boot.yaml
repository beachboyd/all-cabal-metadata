description: |-
  This library is shared between GHC, @ghc-pkg@, and other boot
  libraries.

  A note about "GHC.PackageDb": it only deals with the subset of
  the package database that the compiler cares about: modules
  paths etc and not package metadata like description, authors
  etc. It is thus not a library interface to @ghc-pkg@ and is __not__
  suitable for modifying GHC package databases.

  The package database format and this library are constructed in
  such a way that while @ghc-pkg@ depends on @Cabal@, the GHC library
  and program do not have to depend on @Cabal@.
