synopsis: Library and tool for parsing .eventlog files from GHC
changelog: ! '# Change Log


  ## 0.7.1 - 2018-02-17


  * Export HeapProfBreakdown, HeapProfFlags, and PID types ([#35](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/35))


  ## 0.7.0 - 2017-10-04


  * Add support for heap profiling events ([#29](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/29))


  ## 0.6.0 - 2017-05-31


  This contains breaking changes.


  * The deprecation notice on `readEventLogFromFile` has been retracted

  * The incremental API has been refactored


  The details are as follows:


  * Update bug tracker URL ([#10](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/10))

  * New test for Eden events ([#11](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/11))

  * Relax version bound for binary ([#15](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/15))

  * Enable Travis CI ([#19](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/19))

  * Refactor the incremental API which was introduced in 0.5.0.0 ([#22](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/22))

  * Some speed/memory usage improvements ([#18](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/18),
  [#22](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/22))


  ## 0.5.0.0 - unreleased


  * Readme added :)

  * Old parser replaced with an incremental implementation

  * General overhaul of the codebase

  * Partial Haddock coverage


  The 0.5.* releases should be able to handle large event logs and logs that have
  been cut off abruptly, e.g. from executable runs that resulted in crashes.


  This release should be *mostly* backwards compatible, however the "old" way of reading
  event logs, namely the `readEventLogFromFile`  function is now **deprecated**.


  **NOTE:** Users parsing large logs may notice that this version of the library is
  noticably slower than the older versions. The incremental parser is at fault here
  - previous versions of the libray used a "trick" that would let them essentially
  skip the first step of the mergesort algorithm since `EventBlock`s were already
  sorted in time order. The new parser reads the file incrementally and cannot take
  the advantage of this. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/ghc-events.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/ghc-events)

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ghc-events.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-events)

  [![Hackage-Deps](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/ghc-events.svg)](http://packdeps.haskellers.com/feed?needle=ghc-events)


  A Haskell library for parsing .eventlog files emitted by the GHC runtime system.

  The package also includes an executable, `ghc-events` that can be used to display
  the contents of .eventlog files


  ## TODO

  * Add example usage/tutorial of the new API to this readme


  ## Known Issues

  * Writing event logs back to file does not work. It is hard to say how long has
  this been broken or how difficult will it be to fix ([#14](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/issues/14))
