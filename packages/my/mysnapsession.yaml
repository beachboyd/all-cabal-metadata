description: ! 'This package provides two Snap extensions, implementing

  sessions as either memory-backed arbitrary types, or as

  client-side cookie-backed serializable types.  The latter

  uses the @clientsession@ package to encrypt the cookie for

  security.  In both extensions, sessions are protected from

  session stealing by checking the source IP address, and

  have a configurable timeout (optional for the cookie-

  backed back end).  The session type is user-defined.


  In addition, a library is provided for a continuation-

  based programming model called dialogues, which allows

  natural specification of stateful interactions with the

  client that span multiple requests.  Because the session

  type is not serializable, this requires the memory-backed

  implementation.'
