  only whole seconds are used).  https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/40


  ## 0.4.1.0

  ## 0.3.0.0


  * New maintainer and GitHub location - with many thanks to Bryan O''Sullivan for
  all of the past work on this module, and for facilitating the transfer of maintenance
  responsibility.

  * Extra instances of QueryParams for larger tuples.

  The changes to ResultError and QueryParams were previously unreleased,

  although present in the GitHub repository.  They are the reason for the

  major version bump.
