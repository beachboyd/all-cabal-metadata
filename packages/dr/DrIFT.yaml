changelog: ! "DrIFT-2.3.0:\n  * Publish DrIFT in HackageDB.\n  * Get less warning
  message.\n\n\nDrIFT-2.2.2:\n  * redid build model, collect deriving rules automatically.\n\n\nDrIFT-2.2.1:\n\n
  Mon Aug 14 19:22:26 PDT 2006  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>\n  * update autotools
  to make autoreconf work\n  * update README to reflect there no longer being a 'reconf'
  script\n  * get rid of recursive make in docs/ subdirectory\n\nThu Jan 25 21:04:02
  PST 2007  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>\n  * add support for Data.Binary, move
  old Binary to BitsBinary\n\n\nDrIFT-2.2.0:\n\nMon Apr 10 00:39:24 PDT 2006  John
  Meacham <john@repetae.net>\n  * add note about reconf script\n  * make the parser
  handle newtype deriving without bailing out\n  * fix bug in Ord deriving rule\n\nWed
  Jan 18 03:59:21 PST 2006  David Roundy <droundy@darcs.net>\n  * fix typo in src/Makefile.am\n\nSun
  Nov 27 02:59:14 PST 2005  Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk\n  * Change rule for Haskell2XmlNew
  into XmlContent, add Parse rule.\n  The Haskell2XmlNew class was a temporary staging
  post on the way to\n  developing a new XmlContent class, available in HaXml-1.14
  onwards.\n  This patch updates the name, and the rule, to match the latest\n  developments.
  \ It also adds support for the textual (non-XML) Parse\n  class, which is an experimental
  replacement for the Read class, using\n  monadic parser combinators.  This is also
  currently defined in\n  HaXml-1.14.\n  * docs should refer to StandardRules.hs,
  not .lhs\n  * fix docs for Hugs usage\n  * keep docs of --list option up-to-date\n\nTue
  Nov 15 18:09:40 PST 2005  Einar Karttunen <ekarttun@cs.helsinki.fi>\n  * Hook Arbitrary
  into DrIFT proper\n  * Add UserRuleArbitrary\n\nThu Nov  3 02:52:38 PST 2005  John
  Meacham <john@repetae.net>\n  * fix data derving for new versions of ghc\n\nDrIFT-2.1.2:\n\n
  \ * fix rpm building, autoconf and some general make issues\n  * fix warnings in
  generated binary instances\n  * fix autoconf warnings\n\nMon Sep 12 08:11:10 PDT
  2005  Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk\n  * support for Haskell2XmlNew\n  The HaXml
  library Haskell2Xml has been extended to make secondary parsing\n  of the generic
  XML content tree into a typed value more robust.  An API\n  change means that a
  new version of the class (unimaginatively called\n  Haskell2XmlNew) exists, and
  this patch adds the ability to generate\n  parsing code for the new class.\n  *
  doc updates\n  Fix some very out-of-date statements in the manual.\n\nTue May 31
  16:17:12 PDT 2005  Samuel Bronson <naesten@gmail.com>\n  * avoid problems with hmake
  by invoking ghc -M directly\n  * Default to GHC to avoid NHC's tiny heap\n\nDrIFT-2.1.1:\n\nTue
  Apr 19 21:09:13 PDT 2005  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>\n  * Be sure to flush
  handles pointing to files before quitting\n  * fix off-by-one line number error\n
  \ * Remove reference to genconf\n  * Updated GenUtil.hs to fix nhc build\n\n\nDrIFT-2.1.0:\n
  * added 'get' utility which creates foo_g for each label which returns its\n   value
  in a failing monad rather than raising an error.\n * added 'from' utility which
  creates fromFoo for each constructors\n * no longer an error for DERIVEPATH to not
  be set\n * added -i to ignore directives in file. useful with -g and -r for testing\n
  * added 'Query' which creates from, get, has, and is functions, but in a\n   class
  with an instance for the data type. useful for extensible data types\n * added deriving
  rule for 'Monoid'\n * added code subdirectory with support code\n\nDrIFT-2.0.4:\n
  * added rule for GhcBinary\n * now allows record syntax with newtype\n\nDrIFT-2.0.3:\n
  * 'update' functions now pass through values without the specified field\n * drift-ghc
  script added to be used with ghc by passing -pgmF drift-ghc -F\n * documentation
  updated.\n\nDrIFT-2.0.2:\n * deriving 'update' works with newer versions of ghc\n
  * fixed bug in Show and Read instances\n\nDrIFT-2.0.1:\n * fixed many warnings in
  generated code\n * support for strict fields in constructors\n * support for infix
  constructors\n\nDrIFT-2.0rc4:\n * added help messages and categorization to rules\n
  * small isLiterate fix (TODO use nhcs deliterizer)\n * prints debug info in comment
  in chaseImports\n * code cleanups\n * integrated some changes from Strafunski 1.7\n
  * autoconf/automake improvements\n\nDrIFT-2.0rc3:\n * fixed version strings in generated
  files\n * fix dependency generation\n * fixed example test cases\n\nDrIFT-2.0rc2:\n
  * autoconf/automake added\n * texinfo is installed properly now\n * build system
  cleanups\n * works with both nhc and ghc again\n\nDrIFT-2.0rc1:\n * new texinfo
  documentation, based on Noel's original manual.\n * new option '-r' to only emit
  results and not original source\n * new option '-g' to add new global rules to apply.\n
  * cleaned up old non haskell98-compliant hacks\n\njDrIFT-1:\n * proper GetOpt command
  line handling, allows you to specify an\n   output file (-o) as well as list all
  possible derivations this\n   version was compiled with (-l)\n * proper LINE pragmas
  in generated code\n * smarter error handling in some cases, parser smarter sometimes.\n
  * can deal with/ignore as appropriate some ghc extensions now\n * rules to derive
  Typeable used by the Dynamic library.\n * rules to derive Observable from the HOOD
  object debugger\n * rules to derive Term, a generic term representation for generic\n
  \  computation, can be used in a similar fashion to the Strafunski one,\n   but
  has a number of advantages, fully lazy constant time implode/explode\n   being the
  main one. (the external library is compatable with their work.)\n\n\n"

  package contains a source distribution of DrIFT, a tool for automatic\nderivation
  of Haskell class instances. DrIFT was formerly known as Derive.\n\nThe original
  homepage is at\n[http://repetae.net/john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/](http://repetae.net/john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/).\nBut
  this DrIFT package has some changes with original DrIFT.\n\n## Contents of this
  package:\n\n* src:         Directory with the source files of the DrIFT tool\n*
  example:     Directory with examples of using the DrIFT tool\n* docs:        Documentation\n\n##
  How to install\n\nTo configure and install DrIFT from the source tarball\n\n    $
