description: Provides a simple (but efficient) implementation of the k-means clustering
  algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to, given a set of n-dimensional points,
  regroup them in k groups, such that each point gets to be in the group to which
  it is the closest to (using the 'center' of the group).
