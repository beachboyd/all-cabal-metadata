description: |-
  A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access
  to most interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface
  and X11 library without exposing the programmer to the pain and
  anguish usually associated with using these interfaces.

  The library also includes a module Graphics.SOE providing the
  interface used in "The Haskell School of Expression", by Paul
  Hudak, cf <http://www.haskell.org/soe/>.
