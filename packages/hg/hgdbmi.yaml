description: ! 'GDB\/MI lets programs drive GDB. It can be used, for example, by GDB

  frontends. See section 27 of the GDB manual


  This module encapsualtes a GDB subprocess and provides an API to send

  commands as well as receive both responses and notifications.


  The actual GDB behavior diverges from the GDB manual in many points, so the

  implementation of the Machine Interface highly depends on the GDB version.

  This module is tested with GDB version 7.4.'
