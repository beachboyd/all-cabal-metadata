description: ! 'A graph database storing its data on disk.

  There is currently no transaction or even concurrent access support, this is not
  made for production.

  We try to store the data on disk efficiently, i.e. not rely on having the data in
  memory.

  There is a test suite and a benchmark, which would be the best way to get a feel
  for how the library works.'
