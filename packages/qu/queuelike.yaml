description: ! 'Contains several implementations of data structures implementing a
  /single-in, single-out/ paradigm.  Intended to be a better, more useful replacement
  for pqueue-mtl.

  In particular, includes an experimental and possibly genuinely new trie-based priority
  queue on strings.  Feedback is appreciated.'
