changelog: ! "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\nand
  this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).\n\n##
  [0.4.7] - 2018-03-29\n### Change\n- Split up monolithic module into hidden internal
  modules.\n- Fix compilation regression for older GHCs.\n\n## [0.4.6] - 2018-03-29\n###
  Added\n- Property test the naturality law for `MonadZip`. There is another law\n
  \ that instances should satisfy (the Information Preservation law), but\n  it's
  more difficult to write a test for. It has been omitted for now.\n- Property tests
  for all `MonadPlus` laws.\n- Several additional property tests for list-like containers:
  mapMaybe,\n  replicate, filter.\n\n## [0.4.5] - 2018-03-26\n### Added\n- Property
  tests for list-like containers that have `IsList` instances.\n  These are useful
  for things that are nearly `Foldable` or nearly `Traversable`\n  but are either
  constrained in their element type or totally monomorphic\n  in it.\n\n## [0.4.4]
  - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Cabal flags for controlling whether or not `aeson` and
  `semigroupoids`\n  are used. These are mostly provided to accelerate builds `primitive`'s
  \n  test suite.\n\n## [0.4.3] - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Property tests for `foldl1`
  and `foldr1`.\n- Property tests for `Traversable`.\n\n## [0.4.2] - 2018-03-22\n###
  Changed\n- Made compatible with `transformers-0.3`. Tests for higher-kinded\n  typeclasses
  are unavailable when built with a sufficiently old\n  version of both `transformers`
  and `base`. This is because `Eq1`\n  and `Show1` are unavailable in this situation.\n\n##
  [0.4.1] - 2018-03-21\n### Changed\n- Made compatible with `transformers-0.4`.\n\n##
  [0.4.0] - 2018-03-20\n### Added\n- Property tests for `Bifunctor` and `Alternative`.\n###
  Changed\n- Made compatible with older GHCs all the way back to 7.8.4.\n- Lower dependency
  footprint. Eliminate the dependency on `prim-array`\n  and inline the relevant functions
  and types from it into\n  `Test.QuickCheck.Classes`. None of these are exported.\n"
