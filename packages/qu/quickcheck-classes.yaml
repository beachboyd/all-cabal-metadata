changelog: ! "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\nand
  this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).\n\n##
  [0.4.3] - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Property tests for `foldl1` and `foldr1`.\n-
  Property tests for `Traversable`.\n\n## [0.4.2] - 2018-03-22\n### Changed\n- Made
  compatible with `transformers-0.3`. Tests for higher-kinded\n  typeclasses are unavailable
  when built with a sufficiently old\n  version of both `transformers` and `base`.
  This is because `Eq1`\n  and `Show1` are unavailable in this situation.\n\n## [0.4.1]
  - 2018-03-21\n### Changed\n- Made compatible with `transformers-0.4`.\n\n## [0.4.0]
  - 2018-03-20\n### Added\n- Property tests for `Bifunctor` and `Alternative`.\n###
  Changed\n- Made compatible with older GHCs all the way back to 7.8.4.\n- Lower dependency
  footprint. Eliminate the dependency on `prim-array`\n  and inline the relevant functions
  and types from it into\n  `Test.QuickCheck.Classes`. None of these are exported.\n"
