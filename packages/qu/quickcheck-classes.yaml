changelog: ! "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\nand
  this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).\n\n##
  [0.4.6] - 2018-03-29\n### Added\n- Property test the naturality law for `MonadZip`.
  There is another law\n  that instances should satisfy (the Information Preservation
  law), but\n  it's more difficult to write a test for. It has been omitted for now.\n-
  Property tests for all `MonadPlus` laws.\n- Several additional property tests for
  list-like containers: mapMaybe,\n  replicate, filter.\n\n## [0.4.5] - 2018-03-26\n###
  Added\n- Property tests for list-like containers that have `IsList` instances.\n
  \ These are useful for things that are nearly `Foldable` or nearly `Traversable`\n
  \ but are either constrained in their element type or totally monomorphic\n  in
  it.\n\n## [0.4.4] - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Cabal flags for controlling whether
  or not `aeson` and `semigroupoids`\n  are used. These are mostly provided to accelerate
  builds `primitive`'s \n  test suite.\n\n## [0.4.3] - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Property
  tests for `foldl1` and `foldr1`.\n- Property tests for `Traversable`.\n\n## [0.4.2]
  - 2018-03-22\n### Changed\n- Made compatible with `transformers-0.3`. Tests for
  higher-kinded\n  typeclasses are unavailable when built with a sufficiently old\n
  \ version of both `transformers` and `base`. This is because `Eq1`\n  and `Show1`
  are unavailable in this situation.\n\n## [0.4.1] - 2018-03-21\n### Changed\n- Made
  compatible with `transformers-0.4`.\n\n## [0.4.0] - 2018-03-20\n### Added\n- Property
  tests for `Bifunctor` and `Alternative`.\n### Changed\n- Made compatible with older
  GHCs all the way back to 7.8.4.\n- Lower dependency footprint. Eliminate the dependency
  on `prim-array`\n  and inline the relevant functions and types from it into\n  `Test.QuickCheck.Classes`.
  None of these are exported.\n"
