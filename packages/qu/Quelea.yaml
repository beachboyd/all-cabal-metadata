description: ! 'Quelea is a Haskell library that helps programmers develop highly

  scalable applications on the top of eventually consistent NoSQL stores,

  such as Cassandra. You can think of Quelea as a mediator between the

  application programmer and the underlying NoSQL store. It understands both

  the application requirements and the store semantics, and helps

  programmers use NoSQL stores in such a way so as to maximize performance

  and ensure correct application behaviour, both at the same time!  Among

  other things, Quelea library implements:


  A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that lets NoSQL application programmers

  declare the consistency requirements of their applications as contracts

  (also called specifications)


  A static contract classification procedure that maps high-level

  application contracts to appropriate low-level consistency guarantees

  provided by the underlying NoSQL store, and


  A run-time that runs application operations after tuning the

  store consistency to appropriate levels as determined by the

  contract classification procedure.  While the

  implementations of DSL and the static contract

  classification components are largely independent of the

  actual NoSQL store used, the current implementation of

  run-time component is tailor-made to work with the Cassandra

  data store.'
