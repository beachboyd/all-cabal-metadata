description: ! 'This library defines a set of functions that convert between

  the "Quiver" and "Data.Enumerator" paradigms. The conversion

  is bidirectional: an appropriately-typed stream processor

  can be converted into an ''Data.Enumerator.Iteratee'' and back

  into a stream processor. In addition, a stream processor can

  be fed into an iteratee (or ''Data.Enumerator.Step''),

  resulting in an ''Data.Enumerator.Enumerator''.

  The library has been designed specifically for use with Snap,

  but I''m sure that many other interesting uses of it exist.'
