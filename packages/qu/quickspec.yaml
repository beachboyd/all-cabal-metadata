  QuickSpec: equational laws for free!
  ====================================

  QuickSpec takes your Haskell code and, as if by magic, discovers laws about it.
  You give QuickSpec a collection of Haskell functions; QuickSpec tests your functions
  with QuickCheck and prints out laws which seem to hold.

  For example, give QuickSpec the functions `reverse`, `++` and `[]`, and it will
  find six laws:

  ```haskell
  reverse [] == []
  xs ++ [] == xs
  [] ++ xs == xs
  reverse (reverse xs) == xs
  (xs ++ ys) ++ zs == xs ++ (ys ++ zs)
  reverse xs ++ reverse ys == reverse (ys ++ xs)
  ```

  QuickSpec can find equational laws as well as conditional equations. All you
  need to supply are the functions to test, as well as `Ord` and `Arbitrary`
  instances for QuickSpec to use in testing; the rest is automatic.

  For information on how to use QuickSpec, see
  [the documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickspec/docs/QuickSpec.html).
  You can also look in the `examples` directory, for example at
  `List.hs`, `IntSet.hs`, or `Parsing.hs`. To read about how QuickSpec works, see
  our paper, [Quick specifications for the busy programmer](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nicsma/papers/quickspec2.pdf).
