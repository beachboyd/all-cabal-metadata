description: ! 'The XTC library provides a typed interface to several wxHaskell controls.


  * radio view (typed radio box)


  * single-selection list view (typed single-selection list box)


  * muliple-selection list view (typed multiple-selection list box)


  * choice view (typed choice box)


  * value entry (typed text entry)


  XTC controls keep track of typed values and items, rather than being string based.
  Selections in XTC controls consist of actual values instead of indices.'
