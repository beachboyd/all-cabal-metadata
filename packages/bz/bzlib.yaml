description: |-
  This package provides a pure interface for compressing and
  decompressing streams of data represented as lazy
  'ByteString's. It uses the bz2 C library so it has high
  performance.

  It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most
  tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it
  provides access to the full bzip2 feature set.
