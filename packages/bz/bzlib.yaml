description: ! 'This package provides a pure interface for compressing and

  decompressing streams of data represented as lazy

  ''ByteString''s. It uses the bz2 C library so it has high

  performance.


  It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most

  tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it

  provides access to the full bzip2 feature set.'
