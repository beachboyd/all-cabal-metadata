synopsis: Lens GUI Toolkit
changelog: ! '= lgtk-0.8.0.4 =


  Depend on lensref-0.2


  = lgtk-0.8.0.3 =


  Relax dependencies


  = lgtk-0.8 =


  Lots of changes since the previously announced version, lgtk-0.5.3.


  == New features ==


  * New GLFW backend - Gtk is not strictly needed any more

  * Diagrams canvas with mouse and keyboard interaction support

  * Widget rendering in canvas

  * Horizontal sliders (called scales in Gtk)

  * Updated demo application


  == Architectural changes ==


  * Lens references splitted off to the separate package lensref.

  * Switch from data-lens to Edward Kmett''s lens library

  * Upgrade to work with GHC 8.2

  * Repository moved to GitHub


  == Inner changes ==


  * Cleaned up widgets interface: simpler inner representation of widgets; eliminate
  `SafeIO` and `action`


  == Other changes ==


  * Bugfixes



  = lgtk-0.5.3 =


  * bugfix: handle focus out events for entries

  * bugfix: run postponed actions at widget initialization


  = lgtk-0.5.2 =


  * Better support for references with equality

  * Documentation fixes and cleanup

  * Inner change: safer state handling with MVars


  = lgtk-0.5.1 =


  * Documentation fixes and cleanup

  * Try to support Haskell Platform 2012.4.0.0


  = lgtk-0.5 =


  * Do not use monadic lenses any more.

  * Support for asynchronous events.

  * Lazily created tabs.

  * Inactive tabs are really inactive (event handlers are detached).

  * File references watch the files. When the file changes, the GUI is updated.

  * References with inherent identity (makes defining auto-sensitive buttons easier)

  * Experimental support for coloured buttons.

  * More examples in the demo application.

  * Lots of inner changes.

description: ! 'LGtk is a GUI Toolkit.


  Main goals of LGtk:


  -Provide a Haskell EDSL for declarative description of interactive graphical applications


  -Provide an API for custom widget design


  -Provide a playground for high-level declarative features like

  derived state-save and undo-redo operations and

  type-driven GUI generation
