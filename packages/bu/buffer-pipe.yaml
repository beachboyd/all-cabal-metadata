description: ! 'Read from stdin and write to stdout in large blocks.

  This can be inserted in a chain of piping commands.

  E.g. if inserted after @tar c@ or before @tar x@

  you can reduce jumping forth and back on the hard disk.


  You may also try the @buffer@ command

  from the Debian package of the same name.'
