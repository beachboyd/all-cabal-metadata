description: ! '# burnt-explorer


  This unsophisticated application prints all [`OP_RETURN`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN)
  cryptocurrency transaction outputs in a given block range. Usage:


  ```

  burnt-explorer <start height> <stop height>

  ```


  You must have the `blackcoind` binary (name currently hard-coded) available in `$PATH`.


  Output format is the following:


  ```

  <transaction id> <vout index> <value> <script hex> <decoded script>

  ```


  [`bitcoin-script` package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bitcoin-script) is
  used for decoding scripts.
