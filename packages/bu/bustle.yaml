description: ! "Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal\nemissions,
  method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps\nfor each individual
  event and the duration of each method call. This can\nhelp you check for unwanted
  D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your\nD-Bus-based application isn't performing as
  well as you like. It also\nprovides statistics like signal frequencies and average
  method call\ntimes.\n\n[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bustle/bustle/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bustle/bustle/commits/master)\n\n\nUsing
  Bustle\n============\n\nRun it:\n\n    bustle\n\nNow click **File → New…** to start
  recording session bus traffic. When you're\ndone, click **Stop**, and explore the
  log.\n\nIf you want to record traffic without running the UI (maybe on an embedded\nplatform
  which doesn't have Gtk+ and/or a Haskell compiler), you can use the\nstand-alone
  logger:\n\n    bustle-pcap logfile.bustle\n\nYou can then open `logfile.bustle`
  in Bustle.\n\nYou can also get some ASCII-art\nversion of the statistics shown in
  the UI:\n\n    bustle --count logfile.bustle\n    bustle --time logfile.bustle\n\n\nMore
  information\n================\n\nSee <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Bustle/>.\n"
