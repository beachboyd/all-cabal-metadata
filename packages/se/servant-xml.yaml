  Servant support for XML.


  Types with a `ToXml` instance will be automatically marshalled into XML

  and successfully returned by Servant endpoints.

  Types with a `FromXml` instance can be decoded from request bodies.


  In implementing these typeclass instances, you can use the primatives

  found in the `xmlbf` library.
