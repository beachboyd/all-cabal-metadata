changelog: |
  0.3.0.0: [2019.01.01]
  ---------------------
  * Rename the test suite to make `stack` happy.

  ---------------------
  * Fixed build on GHC-7.4
  * Provide `Semiring` and `Ring` for an arbitrary `Num` via `WrappedNum` newtype.
  * Make note of `Semiring` semantics for `Vector` and `[]` in the documentation.
  * Require build script to ensure `semirings` builds with GHC-8.4.3 and GHC-8.6.1
  * Fixed unlawful behaviour of `[]` `Semiring` instance.
  * Improve performance of `^`.

  * Removed free semiring

  0.2.0.1: [2018.07.28]
  ---------------------
  * Add instances for `Op`, `Equivalence`, `Comparison`, and `Predicate` from Data.Functor.Contravariant (upcoming base 4.12.0.0)
  * docfix for (prod -> product, prod' -> product') change that occured in version 0.2.0.0.

  0.2.0.0: [2018.07.23]
  ---------------------
  * Fixed the `Semiring` instances of `Set`, `HashSet`, `Vector`, `Storable Vector`, `Unboxed Vector`.

  * Added newtypes: `Add`, `Mul`
  * Bounds for containers: [0.3,0.6] -> [0.5.4,0.6.0.9]
  * Add semiring instance for `Proxy`
  * names changed: (prod -> product, prod' -> product')
  * sum' and product' now use foldl' instead of foldr'

  0.1.2: [2018.05.04]
  -------------------

    GHC-7.4.1.

  semirings
  ==========

  Haskellers are usually familiar with monoids and semigroups. A monoid has an appending operation `<>` or `mappend` and an identity element `mempty`. A semigroup has an append `<>`, but does not require an `mempty` element.

  A Semiring has two appending operations, 'plus' and 'times', and two respective identity elements, 'zero' and 'one'.

  More formally, A semiring R is a set equipped with two binary relations + and *, such that:

  - (R, +) is a commutative monoid with identity element 0:
    - (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
    - 0 + a = a + 0 = a
    - a + b = b + a
  - (R, *) is a monoid with identity element 1:
    - (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
    - 1 * a = a * 1 = a
  - Multiplication left and right distributes over addition
    - a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
    - (a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)
  - Multiplication by '0' annihilates R:
    - 0 * a = a * 0 = 0

  *-semirings
  ===========

  A *-semiring (pron. "star-semiring") is any semiring with an additional operation 'star' (read as "asteration"), such that:

  - star a = 1 + a * star a = 1 + star a * a

  A derived operation called "aplus" can be defined in terms of star by:

  - star :: a -> a
  - star a = 1 + aplus a
  - aplus :: a -> a
  - aplus a = a * star a

  As such, a minimal instance of the typeclass 'Star' requires only 'star' or 'aplus' to be defined.

  use cases
  =========

  semirings themselves are useful as a way to express that a type that supports a commutative and associative operation.
  Some examples:

  - Numbers {Int, Integer, Word, Double, etc.}:
    - 'plus' is 'Prelude.+'
    - 'times' is 'Prelude.*'
    - 'zero' is 0.
    - 'one' is 1.
  - Booleans:
    - 'plus' is '||'
    - 'times' is '&&'
    - 'zero' is 'False'
    - 'one' is 'True'
  - Set:
    - 'plus' is 'union'
    - 'times' is 'intersection'
    - 'zero' is the empty Set.
    - 'one' is the singleton Set containing the 'one' element of the underlying type.
  - NFA:
    - 'plus' unions two NFAs.
    - 'times' appends two NFAs.
    - 'zero' is the NFA that acceptings nothing.
    - 'one' is the empty NFA.
  - DFA:
    - 'plus' unions two DFAs.
    - 'times' intersects two DFAs.
    - 'zero' is the DFA that accepts nothing.
    - 'one' is the DFA that accepts everything.

  *-semirings are useful in a number of applications; such as matrix algebra, regular expressions, kleene algebras, graph theory, tropical algebra, dataflow analysis, power series, and linear recurrence relations.
