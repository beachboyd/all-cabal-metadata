description: |
  This library provides combinators to add named arguments to servant endpoints. These combinators are all isomorphic to existing servant combinators, and so a type family `Transform` is also provided for converting namedargs combinators to and from default servant combinators. Following the pattern of servant itself, this library *only* adds the combinators and instances for link generation: for the instances to actually use them with servant-client and servant-server, look at servant-client-namedargs and servant-server-namedargs.
