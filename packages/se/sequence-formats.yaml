synopsis: A package with basic parsing utilities for several Bioinformatic data formats.
changelog: "V 1.5.1: minor updates for hackage\n\nV 1.5.0: Added Plink support.\n\nV
  1.4.1:\n* Added optional genetic position to FreqSumformat,\n* changed various internal
  strings toByteStrings and vice versa.\n\nV 1.4.0.1: Added test file example.pileup
  to cabal extra-source-files to make tests work.\n\nV 1.4.0: Added three features:\n*
  Chromosomes now include `X`, `Y` and `MT` (or `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrMT`), in that
  order after `chr22`. \n* SNP rsId information is now internallyincluded as an option
  in the FreqSum data format.\n* Pileup Format now also records strandorientation\n\nV
  1.3.3: Added Pileup as new format. Changed all tests to Hspec.\n\nV 1.3.2.1: Fixed
  a hard-coded absolute path in the test-suite.\n\nV 1.3.2: Added testDat to Cabal
  file to make tests work off the tarball.\n\nV 1.3.1: Moved test suite outside of
  the main library into the test source directory. Cleaner setup.\n\nV 1.3.0: Removed
  pipes-text, text and turtle dependencies and some more. Restructured all datatypes
  to use Bytestring instead of text. \n\nV 1.2.0: Added tests for VCF, and several
  bugfixes. Now runs on LTS-14.1 with pipes-text as legacy dependency.\n\nV 1.1.8.3:
  Added tests for Fasta import. Succeed.\n\nV 1.1.8.2: Added Eq and Show classes to
  various FreqSum entities. Fixed writing function, added tests.\nV 1.1.8.1: Added
  Eq class to EigenstratInd and Sex\nV 1.1.8: Added more consumers for Bim and Eigenstrat
  Snp files\nV 1.1.7: Added option to parse Bim file (slightly different layout to
  Eigenstrat Snp Format), and added genetic position and snpId to the EigenstratSnpEntry
  datastructure. This will cause breaking changes in code linking against this library.\nV
  1.1.6: VCF parser now allows for truncated VCF files with no Format and Genotypes
  (sites-only VCF files)\nV 1.1.5: Fixed VCF parser: Now breaks if lines end prematurely\nV
  1.1.4.2: Exporting readVCFfromProd\nV 1.1.4.1: First entry in the Changelog. Added
  Haddock documentation to all modules and prepare for releasing on Hackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  Sequence-Formats is a Haskell package to provide file parsers and writers for some commonly, and less commonly used file formats in Bioinformatics, speficially population genetics.

  The library makes heavy use of the [pipes library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) to provide Producers and Consumers for reading and writing files.
