synopsis: A Haskell library to make self-extracting executables
changelog: ! '## self-extract 0.2.0.0


  Fixed bug due to stripping the exes after bundling, which is only a problem when
  bundling multiple

  executables in a package.


  Major fixes:

  * Packages should use `bundle` in the `postCopy` hook, rather than the `postBuild`
  hook.


  Other fixes:

  * Updated documentation


  ## self-extract 0.1.0.0


  * Initial implementation

description: ! "# self-extract\n\nA Haskell library that can make an executable self-extracting.\n\n##
  Usage\n\n### .cabal file\n\n```\n...\nbuild-type: Custom\n...\n\ncustom-setup\n
  \ setup-depends: base, Cabal, self-extract\n\n...\n\nexecutable name-of-executable\n
  \ build-depends: self-extract, ...\n  ...\n```\n\n### Setup.hs\n\n```\nimport Codec.SelfExtract.Distribution
  (bundle)\nimport Distribution.Simple\n\nmain = defaultMainWithHooks simpleUserHooks\n
  \ { postCopy = \\args cf pd lbi -> do\n      postCopy simpleUserHooks args cf pd
  lbi\n      bundle \"name-of-executable\" \"dir-to-bundle\" lbi\n  }\n```\n\n###
  Executable file\n\n```\nimport Codec.SelfExtract (extractTo)\n\nmain = do\n  extractTo
  \"dir\" -- will extract to $CWD/dir\n  extractTo \"/usr/local/lib\"\n  ...\n```\n\nExtract
  to a temporary directory:\n\n```\nimport Codec.SelfExtract (withExtractToTemp)\nimport
  System.Directory (removeDirectory)\n\nmain = do\n  withExtractToTemp $ \\tmp ->
  do\n    ...\n```\n\n### Details\n\nThe above instructions should be a black box,
  but here is an explanation of the implementation\nif you need to know the details
  of how it works.\n\nWhen the executable containing `extractTo` is built, some space
  will be allocated to contain the\nsize of the binary.\n\n`bundle` will find the
  executable from `LocalBuildInfo`'s `buildDir`. It will take the directory\nspecified
  and run `tar` on it. It will also get the size of the executable and write the size
  into\nthe space allocated by `extractTo`. Then `bundle` will replace the executable
  with the executable\nitself concatenated with the tar archive.\n\nWhen `extractTo`
  is called, it will read the size of the executable that was written in `bundle`.\nAfter
  seeking to the size of the binary, the tar archive can be extracted to the desired
  directory.\n"
