description: ! "# haskell-secureUDP\n\nHaskell module for secure UDP packet transfer.\n\n-
  Packets **ARE** guaranteed to be received (and as fast as possible) if there's a
  connection.\n- Packets **ARE** guaranteed to arrive just once.\n- Packets **ARE
  NOT** guaranteed to arrive in order.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- It's recommended that on
  the ChannelConfig, the maxPacketSize isn't set to a value\n    larger than 500.
  Theoretically the IP protocol should partition packages larger than the MTU,\n    however
  the packages could be dropped.\n- To avoid communication problems, all communicating
  channels should have the same ChannelConfig,\n    except by the `socket` or the
  `allowed` function.\n"
