synopsis: The client implementation of servant-rawm.
changelog: |+
  ## 1.0.0.1

  *   Bump the version lower bound of servant-rawm to 1.0

  ## 1.0.0.0

  *   The implementations of the `RawM` endpoint are divided into
      `servant-rawm-client`, `servant-rawm-docs`, and `servant-rawm-server` to
      avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies and reduce the compilation
      overhead. You will need to add either of the implementations to your
      dependencies, and import the corresponding implementation
      (`Servant.RawM.Server`, `Servant.RawM.Client`, or `Servant.RawM.Docs`) for
      the `RawM` endpoint to function correctly.

  This is the client-side library for
  [`servant-rawm`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-rawm).

  See the `servant-rawm`
  [`README.md`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-rawm) and
  [Haddocks](side://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-rawm)
  for a short explanation of how to use this package.

  After `servant-rawm` 1.0.0.0, the implementations of the `RawM` endpoint are
  divided into `servant-rawm-client`, `servant-rawm-docs`, and
  `servant-rawm-server` to avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies and reduce
  the compilation overhead.
