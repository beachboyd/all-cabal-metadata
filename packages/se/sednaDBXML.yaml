description: ! 'SednaDBXML is a Haskell library and a binding to

  the C language drivers of sedna native XML

  Database System.


  This software is in an extremely early state. The

  low level c bindings are still being established

  and work on the higher level abstractions have yet

  to begin.


  Please keep an eye on this repository and watch

  for changes. In the mean time, checkout the sedna

  homepage http://www.sedna.org/ and try some of the

  other excellent language bindings for sedna.
