description: ! 'This package provides an @Auth@ combinator for ''servant''. This combinator

  allows using different authentication schemes in a straightforward way,

  and possibly in conjunction with one another.


  ''servant-auth'' additionally provides concrete authentication schemes, such

  as Basic Access Authentication, JSON Web Tokens, and Cookies.
