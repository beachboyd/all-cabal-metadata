description: ! "Sequential index numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that allow arbitrarily
  inserting new numbers in between. They can possibly used for disk-based and other
  special containers, where adding a new element without changing the indexes of the
  other elements is important.\n\nConceptually, SequentialIndex denotes a path to
  an element in an imaginary binary tree, with a '1' at the end. Except for 0.0 and
  1.0, which are logically on the left or on the right of the entire tree.\n\nSo logically,
  the tree looks roughly like this:\n\n0.0                          1.0\n                            /\n
  \               /----------/\n              0.1\n              / \\\n          /--/
  \  \\--\\\n         /           \\\n       0.01         0.11\n       / \\          /
  \\\n  0.001   0.011     ...\n\nNote that 0.0 is not connected to any other node,
  but it is still logically smaller than all nodes.\n"
