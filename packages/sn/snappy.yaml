description: ! '# Welcome to snappy


  snappy is a fast Haskell library for working with data compressed

  using Google''s Snappy format.  It is implemented as a binding to the

  [Snappy library](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/).


  It implements zero-copy compression and decompression of both strict

  and lazy [bytestring](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring)s,

  the standard Haskell types for managing binary data efficiently.
