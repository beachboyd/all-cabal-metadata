  Snap Framework
  ==============

  Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
  Haskell. For more information about Snap, read the `README.SNAP.md` or visit the
  Snap project website at http://www.snapframework.com/.

  ## Library contents

  This is utility project for the Snap Framework, which contains a
  library allowing Snap applications to run at full compiled speed with
  no overhead, in a way that's drop-in compatible with
  snap-loader-dynamic.

  Building snap-loader-static
  ===========================

  This library is built using
  [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/) and
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html). Just run

      cabal install

  from the `snap-loader-static` toplevel directory.


  ## Building the Haddock Documentation

  The haddock documentation can be built using 'cabal haddock'.

  The docs get put in `dist/doc/html/`.
