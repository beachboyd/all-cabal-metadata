description: ! 'S-Net is a declarative coördination language for describing streaming

  networks of asynchronous components. Streaming networks are defined using

  an expression language of four network combinators: serial composition,

  parallel composition, serial replication and parallel replication. One-shot

  data synchronisation is provided by the built-in syncrocell component.


  Streams are associated with record types; collections of data where each

  item is uniquely identified by its name. Structural subtyping on these

  record types directs the flow of data through the streaming network.
