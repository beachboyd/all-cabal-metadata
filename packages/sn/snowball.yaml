description: ! 'The Snowball library is used to compute the stems of words

  in natural languages.


  Compared to the older <stemmer> package, this one:


  * Correctly handles unicode without relying on the system

  locale


  * Takes greater care to avoid memory leaks and to be thread

  safe


  * Uses Text rather than String


  * Gets rid of the need for @stemWords@ by using rewrite

  rules to make @map stem@ efficient


  * Includes a more recent release of Snowball


  * Attempts to comply with the Snowball licensing terms


  * Supports @SafeHaskell@ when available and is otherwise

  @Haskell2010@


  * Comes with a test suite


  However, although this code is written from scratch, it is

  heavily modeled after the code of the \"stemmer\" package.'
