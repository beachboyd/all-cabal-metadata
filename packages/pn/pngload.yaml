description: ! "\nThis is the beginnings of a pure Haskell loader for PNG images.
  It\nstores the uncompressed image in a StorableArray (Int,Int) Word8, so\nit should
  be convenient to use as a texture loader in OpenGL\napplications since you can get
  a Ptr Word8 to the image data easily.\n\nThe performance is reasonable (the following
  run loads an 1.5megabyte\n1024x768 24bit PNG image and writes out the raw bytes
  on a 2GHz\nMacBook):\n\nMars2:PNG marko$ time ./Test scenery_1\n\nreal\t0m0.315s\nuser\t0m0.267s\nsys\t0m0.027s\n\nSource
  for the test is in Test.hs.\n\nNote that the library has not been tested with every
  possible kind of\nPNG images, so use at your own risk.\n"
