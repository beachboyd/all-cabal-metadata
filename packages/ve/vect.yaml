description: ! 'A low-dimensional (2, 3 and 4) linear algebra library,

  with lots of useful functions. Intended usage is primarily

  computer graphics (basic OpenGL support is included as a separate package).

  Projective 4 dimensional operations, as used in eg. OpenGL,

  are also supported; and so are quaternions.

  The base field is either Float or Double.'
