synopsis: A buffer compatible with Data.Vector.*
changelog: ! "0.1:\n\t\tinitial version\n\n0.1.0.1:\n\t\tadded bangs to go functions
  in mapBufferM*\n\n0.1.0.2:\n\t\trationalised index computation\n\t\tstore size of
  buffer (replicates vector internals -- boo)\n\n0.1.0.3:\n\t\tuse `mod` for index

description: ! 'A buffer type that can easily be converted to a Data.Vector.Storable
  vector

  from the vector package and compatible with hmatrix.


  Elements are pushed into the buffer.  When the buffer is converted to a read-only

  vector, the last-pushed element occurs at the end.


  Monadic map functions also operate so that the last-pushed element is treated last.'
