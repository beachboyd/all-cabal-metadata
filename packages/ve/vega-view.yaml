  # vega-view

  I am not 100% convinced this is a worthwhile project, but let's see how
  it goes.

  The aim is to make it easy to view
  [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
  and
  [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
  specifications - i.e. the JSON representing a visualization - as
  a visualization. It relies on
  [Vega Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) to do all
  the hard work, and just provides a basic web server that will list the
  files in a given directory and, when selected, create the
  call to Vega Embed.

  ## License

  This is released under a BSD3 license.

  ## Usage

  The server - called `vega-view` - should be run from the directory
  containing the specifications to view. It then provides a web server
  on port 8082 that can be used to view them at the URL

      http://localhost:8082/display/

  ## GHC support

  This is currently a **very basic** application, so will hopefully build
  against a wide variety of GHC installations. There has been /no/ testing
  on Windows.

  ## Bugs and Issues

  Please use the [issues list](https://github.com/DougBurke/vega-view/issues)
  to report any problems.
