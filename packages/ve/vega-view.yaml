  # Changelog for vega-view

  ## 0.3.0.0

  Add drag-and-drop support to the main page. You can now drag in a file
  (or multiple files) and have their contents be displayed. There is a mode
  for selecting how new visualizations are added to the page: at the top
  (default), at the bottom, or clear-out any previous plots.

  ## 0.2.0.2

  Bump base minimum version to supporg ghc 8 or later, to save
  hackage trying to build with older versions. There is no user-visible
  change to version 0.2.

  ## 0.2.0.1

  Internal change to get it to build with ghc 8.2 and 8.0.

  ## 0.2

  The directory view now displays all the visualizations in a directory,
  and hides those files that are not JSON. Selecting a visualization can
  now open it in a new page (0.1 behavior) or inline (new).

description: "# vega-view\n\nI am not 100% convinced this is a worthwhile project,
  but let's see how\nit goes. You can think of it as \"I want\n[vega desktop](https://github.com/vega/vega-desktop)
  but don't want\nto install an electron application, so decided to write an inferior\nproduct\"
  project.\n\nThe aim is to make it easy to view\n[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)\nand\n[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)\nspecifications
  - i.e. the JSON representing a visualization - as\na visualization. It relies on\n[Vega
  Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) to do all\nthe hard work, and just provides
  a basic web server that:\n\n - you can drag-and-drop files onto to view them;\n
  \n - and will list the files in a given directory and, when selected,\n   view them
  inline or on a separate page.\n\n## License\n\nThis is released under a BSD3 license.\n\n##
  Usage\n\nThe server - called `vega-view` - should be run from the directory\ncontaining
  the specifications to view. It then provides a web server\non port 8082 that can
  be used to view them at the URL\n\n    http://localhost:8082/display/\n\nVisualizations
  can either be viewed as their own \"page\", or inline,\nwhich may be more useful
  when you have multiple plots to view.\n\nThe aim is to be run in a a directory structure
  where most, if not\nall, the files are Vega or Vega-Lite specifications. This means
  that\nthe web server tries to parse each file as JSON, which could cause\nmemory-
  or time- issues if there are large non-JSON files in the\ndirectory tree.\n\n##
  GHC support\n\nThis is currently a **very basic** application, so will hopefully
  build\nagainst a wide variety of GHC installations. There has been /no/ testing\non
  Windows.\n\n## Bugs and Issues\n\nPlease use the [issues list](https://github.com/DougBurke/vega-view/issues)\nto
  report any problems.\n"
