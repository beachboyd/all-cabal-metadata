  # Changelog for vega-view

  ## 0.3.0.5

  Improved error handling when displaying Vega or Vega-Lite specifications,
  in that the error message from vega-embed is now shown to the viewer rather
  than hidden away in the console log. It is not clear to me how useful these
  error messages are, other than just to say "hey, something went wrong".

  The filenames for the export-to-svg/png options now uses the specification
  file name rather than the default "visualization". There is no attempt to
  remove any suffixes from the file name, so "foo.vg.json" will end up as
  "foo.vg.json.svg" (or .png).

  Removed paths from file names in the directory listings, and also stopped
  dropping their suffixes.

  ## 0.3.0.4

  Fixed directory browsing: previously things didn't work out so well if
  there were no Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations in the working directory,
  but now you can properly recurse into sub-directories.

  ## 0.3.0.3

  Oops: chaning from a bytestring to a text during development caused
  "problems". There really should be a swooshy icon on the home page now,
  and the a text rendering of the SVG...

  ## 0.3.0.2

  Add a link back to the "home page" in the page header.

  The home page has a swooshy icon on it, to try and visually indicate
  that you can drag onto the page.

  ## 0.3.0.1

  Tweak the styling on some of the pages to use the "new look"â„¢.

  ## 0.3.0.0

  Add drag-and-drop support to the main page. You can now drag in a file
  (or multiple files) and have their contents be displayed. There is a mode
  for selecting how new visualizations are added to the page: at the top
  (default), at the bottom, or clear-out any previous plots.

  ## 0.2.0.2

  Bump base minimum version to supporg ghc 8 or later, to save
  hackage trying to build with older versions. There is no user-visible
  change to version 0.2.

  ## 0.2.0.1

  Internal change to get it to build with ghc 8.2 and 8.0.

  ## 0.2

  The directory view now displays all the visualizations in a directory,
  and hides those files that are not JSON. Selecting a visualization can
  now open it in a new page (0.1 behavior) or inline (new).

  ## 0.1

description: "# vega-view\n\nI am not 100% convinced this is a worthwhile project,
  but let's see how\nit goes. You can think of it as \"I want\n[vega desktop](https://github.com/vega/vega-desktop)
  but don't want\nto install an electron application, so decided to write an inferior\nproduct\"
  project.\n\nThe aim is to make it easy to view\n[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)\nand\n[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)\nspecifications
  - i.e. the JSON representing a visualization - as\na visualization. It relies on\n[Vega
  Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) to do all\nthe hard work, and just provides
  a basic web server that:\n\n - you can drag-and-drop files onto to view them;\n
  \n - and will list the files in a given directory and, when selected,\n   view them
  inline or on a separate page.\n\n## License\n\nThis is released under a BSD3 license.\n\n##
  Usage\n\nThe server - called `vega-view` - should be run from the directory\ncontaining
  the specifications to view. It then provides a web server\non port 8082 that can
  be used to view them at the URLs\n\n    http://localhost:8082/\n    http://localhost:8082/display/\n\nThe
  first page lets you drag-and-drop files onto the page to view\nthem. Thse second
  lets you browse the visualizations that are present\nin the diectory where you started
  the application. Thse can either be\nviewed as their own \"page\", or inline, which
  may be more useful when\nyou have multiple plots to view.\n\nThe aim is to be run
  in a a directory structure where most, if not\nall, the files are Vega or Vega-Lite
  specifications. This means that\nthe web server tries to parse each file as JSON,
  which could cause\nmemory- or time- issues if there are large non-JSON files in
  the\ndirectory tree.\n\n## GHC support\n\nThis is currently a **very basic** application,
  so will hopefully build\nagainst a wide variety of GHC installations. There has
  been /no/ testing\non Windows.\n\n## Bugs and Issues\n\nPlease use the [issues list](https://github.com/DougBurke/vega-view/issues)\nto
  report any problems.\n"
