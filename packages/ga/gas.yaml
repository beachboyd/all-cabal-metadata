description: ! 'Programs constructed using free applicatives or free monads may be
  analyzed

  statically or dynamically (respectively). This package uses such analysis

  to limit the number of steps the program may take. This is useful for EDSLs

  with untrusted input, or in general when you want to guarantee termination

  by cutting off a program.


  Note that this package does not avoid infinite loops in bottom values. Use

  the "System.Timeout" module for that instead.'
