description: ! 'Gargoyle is a framework for managing daemons from Haskell. In the
  current release the only requirement is that the daemon be able to communicate over
  a Unix domain socket. See <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gargoyle-postgresql
  gargoyle-postgresql> for a fully worked out example.


  To use Gargoyle the client must:


  1. Define a value of the ''Gargoyle'' type which specifies how to administer the
  daemon.

  2. Create an executable whose `main` is ''gargoyleMain''. The name of this executable
  should match the executable name specified in the ''_gargoyle_exec'' field of the
  ''Gargoyle''.

  3. The client will run their code with ''withGargoyle'' to gain access to the daemon.'
