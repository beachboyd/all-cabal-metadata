description: ! 'A JoinList - a list type with with cheap catenation.


  Generally speaking, joinlists have cheap construction (cons,

  snoc and join aka. append) and expensive manipulation. For most

  use-cases Data.Sequence is a more appropriate data structure.


  Changelog


  0.3.0 - Added views as per Data.Sequence and takes and drops.

  Changed show instance to mimic Data.Sequence.


  0.2.0 - more operations and some bugfixes (toList...), @wrap@

  renamed to @singleton@.'
