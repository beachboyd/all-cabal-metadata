description: ! "# Ebnf2ps\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/Ebnf2ps.png)](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/Ebnf2ps)\n\nEbnf2ps
  generates nice looking syntax diagrams in EPS and FIG format\nfrom EBNF specifications
  and from yacc, bison, and Happy input\ngrammars. The diagrams can be immediatedly
  included in TeX/LaTeX\ndocuments and in texts created with other popular document
  preparation\nsystems.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe latest version of the manual is available
  in [`doc.pdf`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FranklinChen/Ebnf2ps/master/doc/doc.pdf).\n\nTwo
  environment variables may need to be set:\n\n- Find out where your `TeX` installation
  stores\n  `.afm`-files (Adobe font metric files). Then set the\n  environment variable
  `AFMPATH` when running the program. The\n  `.afm`-files are absolutely necessary.
  If you don't find them\n  complain to your system administrator or get them yourself.
  One\n  possible source is [here](https://github.com/weiss/original-bsd/tree/master/local/transcript/lib/).\n-
  Set the environment variable `RGBPATH` to contain the directory\n  where your X
  installation stores its color data base (usually\n  `/usr/lib/X11`). There are fallback
  color definitions for the 8\n  digital colors (black, white, blue, green, cyan,
  red,\n  magenta, yellow), so nothing needs be done if that's enough for you.\n\n
  \ Note: for Mac OS X, the default `/opt/X11/share/X11` has been\n  provided and
  will work automatically, if you have installed X using\n  [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/).\n\n##
  Notes\n\nWith Peter Thiemann's permission, I am now maintaining this package, starting
  with version 1.0.12.\n\nI first used this software in 1995 (!), so it was a nostalgia
  trip finding it again in 2014 and reviving it. PostScript is no longer in fashion,
  but one can still use this tool and then convert PostScript to PDF.\n"
