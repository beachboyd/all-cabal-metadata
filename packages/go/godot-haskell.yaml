  Haskell bindings for the Godot game engine.

  * Low-level stuff (GDNative) resides in Godot.Gdnative

  * Nativescript stuff (binding classes/methods/etc) is in Godot.Nativescript

  * High-level stuff (classes generated from the API description) is in Godot.Api,
  whereas methods are in Godot.Methods


  For an example project by lboklin, see addons/godot-haskell-plugin at https://gitlab.com/lboklin/godot-haskell-test/tree/godot-project


  Questions, etc are best asked in the Gitter chatroom for SimulaVR: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula.svg)](https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)


  # Docs

  The Haskell specific stuff is documented, but I''m not importing the docstrings
  from the Godot API yet. Refer to the Godot docs for that
