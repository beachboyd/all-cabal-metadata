  ============


  Core package of game engine called Gore&Ash. The engine has following features:


  - based on arrowised FRP ([netwire](https://wiki.haskell.org/Netwire))


  - provides high-modularity and reusability. Actually the core can only compose modules
  that extends engine capabilities.


  - actor based style of programming, see [gore-and-ash-actor](https://github.com/Teaspot-Studio/gore-and-ash-actor)
  module.


  - network API over UDP with user controlled reliability, see [gore-and-ash-network](https://github.com/Teaspot-Studio/gore-and-ash-network)
  module.


  - synchronization EDSL that greately simplifies complexity of client-server programming,
  see [gore-and-ash-sync](https://github.com/Teaspot-Studio/gore-and-ash-sync) module.


  - input module via SDL2 library, see [gore-and-ash-sdl](https://github.com/Teaspot-Studio/gore-and-ash-sdl)
  module.


  For complete proof-of-concept, see [gore-and-ash-demo](https://github.com/Teaspot-Studio/gore-and-ash-demo)
  repo that contains implementation of simple game.


  Making your own module

  ======================


  You can generate backbone of core module with `stack`:


  ```

  stack new gore-and-ash-testtemp ./gore-and-ash-module.hsfiles -p module-name:TestTemp
  -p module-name-lower:testtemp --solver
