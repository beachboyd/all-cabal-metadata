  Or **j**ustus-**a**dam-base-extra, which is the expanded form.


  This is a library of small helper functions that I use and that depend only on the
  `base` library. But of which I am certain they would never be added to the actual
  `base` library.


  Most of these functions are simple to implement and do not warrant including a library,
  however I like to do so regardless, because it thins out the usual `MyProject.Util`
  module.


  ## Usage


  Just add as dependency and `import Original.Module.JAExtra`. Currently available
  on [hackage][].

  ## Naming


  This library is named after me for two reasons:


  1. because it is an opinionated library of things that I thought were necessary
  and

  2. because naming it and the included modules something generic is not cool, if
  it is not generic by design (like the `extra` library)


  ## Documentation


  Haddock documentation is provided. If you are unhappy with the documentation [let
  me know](mailto:dev@justus.science) or [submit a pull request][pr].

  ## Contributing


  I am happy about any contribution. Just [submit a pull request][pr].


  Be aware though that I might reject proposals because I judge them unfitting, it
  is after all an opinionated library.
