description: ! "A Bookmarks Manager with an HTML Generator.\nIt depends on two of
  my libraries, Simtreelo and DescriLo, which may be obtained at Hackage or:\n\nmgmillani@hub.darcs.net:mgmillani/DescriLo\nmgmillani@hub.darcs.net:mgmillani/Simtreelo\n\n######\n\nWhen
  executed, boomange tries to find the system default configuration directory, using
  the following priority:\n1 - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/boomange\n2 - $HOME/.config/boomange\n3
  - Haskell's getAppUserDataDirectory boomange\n\nIt then checks if the directory
  exists. If it does, it loads the 'config' file that must be there.\nIf it does not
  exists, boomange creates the folder, together with a sample configuration, including
  a .css file and examples of bookmarks.\n\n######\n\nThe config file contains 2 descriptions:\n\nconfig
  - configuration of what boomange should do. The possible values inside are:\n\toutput
  - where the HTML should be placed after generation\n\theaderFile - file that will
  be prepended to output\n\tfooterFile - file that will be appended to output\n\t\nwatch
  - all files that should be watched for bookmarks. The left part of every value is
  irrelevant, and the right part indicates which file should be read. Each file should
  be a simtree (which is loaded by SimtreeLo), and all leaves are treated as the URL
  of their parent, which means that no parent should have more than 1 leaf as its
  children.\n"
