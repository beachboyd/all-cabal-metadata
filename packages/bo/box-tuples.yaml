  As of now, the GHCi interactive runtime is incapable of working on unboxed
  tuples. In particular, it is unable to fully apply any function returning an
  unboxed tuple, create a function that takes a non-nullary unboxed tuple as
  argument, or pass a non-nullary tuple to some other function. The usual
  solution is to enable object code generation with @-fobject-code@. This
  package serves as a workaround for the cases where @-fobject-code@ is
  undesiable.
