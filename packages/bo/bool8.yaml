description: ! 'The standard ''Bool'' type has a ''Storable'' instance

  that requires the size of @HTYPE_INT@,

  i.e. usually four bytes or even more.

  This package provides ''Bool8'',

  a boolean type with an 8 bit representation in memory.

  It is not a drop-in replacement for ''Bool'' though.

  You have to convert from or to ''Bool'' occasionally.'
