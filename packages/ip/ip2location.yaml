description: This Haskell package provides a fast lookup of country, region, city,
  latitude, longitude, ZIP code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection type, IDD
  code, area code, weather station code, weather station name, mcc, mnc, mobile brand,
  elevation, and usage type from IP address by using IP2Location database. This package
  uses a file based database available at IP2Location.com. This database simply contains
  IP blocks as keys, and other information such as country, region, city, latitude,
  longitude, ZIP code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection type, IDD code, area
  code, weather station code, weather station name, mcc, mnc, mobile brand, elevation,
  and usage type as values. It supports both IP addresses in IPv4 and IPv6.
