description: ! "# hfd\n\n## About\n\nhfd is a console debugger for flash applications.\nIt
  is written in Haskell.\n\n## hfd vs fdb\n\nFlash debugger, included into flex sdk
  (fdb) lacks good readline interface.\nAlso it very often fails (and even crashes)
  when printing properties (at least linux version).\nSo the idea is to create flash
  debugger with user friendly interface and good properties support.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou
  need Haskell Platform to install hfd.\n\n    $ cd hfd\n    $ cabal update\n    $
  cabal install\n\n## Current state\n\nhfd supports most of basic debugger features\n\n*
  set, list, delete breakpoints\n* execution control: continue, step, next, finish\n*
  inspect variable\n* inspect properties (call getters)\n* break on exception\n* show
  call stack\n* list source code (currently only around current position)\n* haskeline
  user interface (commands history, basic completion)\n\nFeatures, that are not implemented
  still\n\n* improved listing of source code\n* walk through call stack\n* enable/disable
  breakpoints\n* conditional breakpoints\n* expression evaluation\n* set variables\n*
  print arguments when printing call stack\n* improved completion\n\n"
