  ViennaRNA RNAfold v2, MFE variant

  using the ADPfusion library




  Introduction

  ============


  This algorithm is the second, and much larger, test case for ADPfusion. We

  implement "RNAfold v2" in the MFE variant using "-d2" dangles. Both a library

  version and an executable are created. The "RNAFold" binary expects single

  sequences, one per line. Backtracking tracks all co-optimal structures.




  Installation

  ============


  A simple "cabal update && cabal-dev install RNAFold" should be enough.




  Runtime notes

  =============


  Using Haskell and ADPfusion, we come to within x3-x4 for this package. Between

  the initial test case / submission (in 0.0.0.3) I have traded in some

  performance improvements for much better readability in BioInf.RNAfold.Energy.

  The C version of RNAfold employs some other methods to improve performance.

  Consider:


  base -~+ inner-1 +~- base

  base -~+ inner-2 +~- base


  where it is advantageous to calculate the outer basepair only once, not twice

  as we are doing. It is probably better to try to improve the handling of

  fusioned code and/or final assembler generation than finding calculations

  common to different parts of CFG''s.
