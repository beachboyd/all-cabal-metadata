description: ! 'Omega is a purely functional programming language (like Haskell)

  and it also enables built-in proofs about program correctness

  employing the Curry-Howard correspondence. Powerful metaprogramming

  facilities and extensible syntax for data make programming a less

  verbose experience.'
