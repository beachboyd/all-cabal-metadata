description: ! 'BBDB (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/) is a

  contact management utility that can be used with

  emacs.  It stores its data internally as a lisp

  expression.  This module parses the lisp and

  provides some convenience functions to get at and

  manipulate the data all from within Haskell.  See

  the hackage docs for usage and examples.'
