changelog: ! 'Changes for Database/BBDB

  =========================


  from 0.5 -> 0.6

  The new BBDB version (BBDB3) uses file format 9 now.  Three fields were

  added: a hash field, a creation date field, and a modification time

  field.  Theses used to be present in the notes field.



  from 0.4 -> 0.5

  ---------------


  The BBDB file format changed.  The current version of the format

  is 7.  Once field, called *Affixes* was added, and now the extension

  in a US phone field is required.

description: ! 'Database.BBDB

  =============


  A relatively primitive (but working) Haskell library to read and write

  BBDB (Insidious Big Brother Database) files.  One major goal was to be

  able to have the following be the identity function:


  ```Haskell

  d <- readBBDB "/path/to/.bbdb"

  -- d is now a Haskell data type

  writeFile (asLisp d) "path/to/copy-of-.bbdb"

  ```


  Because of this goal, the interface is based on lists, and tends to be

  a lot of work to get to the actual data you are looking for.  Sorry

  about that.'
