  Interactive domain reasoner for statistics, based on the feedback services
  of the Ideas framework. Provides feedback and hints on step-by-step construction
  of hypothesis tests by students. Test types supported include z-tests, t-tests
  for one group, dependent groups and independent groups, correlation, ANOVA and
  Chi-square tests. The domain reasoner is used by the learning environment Numworx
  (www.numworx.nl) and is available for implementation in other learning
  environments as well.
