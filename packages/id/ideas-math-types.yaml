description: |-
  This package provides common datatypes and utility functions for
  mathematical domain reasoners that are based on the 'ideas' software
  package. The package is currently used by our logic tutors (dnf/cnf
  normal forms, equational proofs, axiomatic proofs, inductive proofs),
  the statistics tutor that provides feedback on the structure of
  hypothesis tests, and the analyzers of the Advise-Me project. Contact
  the package maintainers for further information about the package.
