description: ! 'The goal of this Haskell library is to support conversions of

  (internationalized) domain names between the ASCII (ACE) and Unicode encodings

  in accordance with IDNA2008 (RFC 5991: Internationalized Domain Names in

  Applications (IDNA): Protocol).


  The current version, 0.0.1.0, supports encoding a Unicode hostname to an ASCII

  hostname. Note however that the code is currently prototyped and untested.


  A later version will add validation support.
