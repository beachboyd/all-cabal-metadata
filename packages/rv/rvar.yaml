description: |-
  Random number generation based on modeling random
  variables by an abstract type ('RVar') which can be
  composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
  either monadic or \"pure\" styles.

  The primary purpose of this library is to support
  defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
  random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
  but performance is an important goal too.

  In my testing, I have found it capable of speed
  comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
  a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of
  the same algorithms.

  Changes in 0.2.0.1:  Version bump for transformers
  dependency.
