  # README

  This package provides a simple wrapper for the `gloss` library,
  or rather the function `Graphics.Gloss.play`,
  enabling you to write `gloss` applications as signal functions.
  An example "gears" program, which you can run as `cabal run rhine-gloss-gears`
  or `stack build && stack exec rhine-gloss-gears`,
  now becomes as simple as:

  ```haskell
  import FRP.Rhine.Gloss


  -- | Calculate a gear wheel rotated by a certain angle.
  gears :: Float -> Picture
  gears angle = color green $ pictures
    $ circleSolid 60
    : map (rotate angle) [ rotate (45 * n) $ rectangleSolid 20 150 | n <- [0..3] ]

  -- | Rotate the gear with a constant angular velocity.
  mainClSF :: GlossClSF a
  mainClSF = timeInfoOf sinceInit >>> arr (* 50) >>> arr gears

  main :: IO ()
  main = flowGloss (InWindow "rhine-gloss-gears" (400, 400) (10, 10)) (greyN 0.3) 30
       $ buildGlossRhine Just mainClSF
  ```

  ## Installation

  Since `gloss` is based on `OpenGL`,
  you will need to install the same dependencies as for that.
  Typically, this are the `GL`, `GLU` and `GLUT` libraries.
  (On Debian-like systems, `sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev` should suffice.)

  When building with `stack`, it is assumed that you have `nix-shell` installed,
  which will automatically get these dependencies for you.
