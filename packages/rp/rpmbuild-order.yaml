  # rpmbuild-order

  This package based on code from [cabal-sort](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-sort), sorts rpm package spec files by build order.

      $ rpmbuild-order --help
      $ rpmbuild-order sort mycore mylib myapp
      mylib
      mycore
      myapp

  The arguments passed can either be directories named after the package, or spec files.

  By default it outputs the package names, but it can also output
  the spec filenames or directory paths for easier scripting.

  Using the rpmbuild-order `deps` and `rdeps` commands the ordered
  dependencies and reverse dependencies of a package can be obtained
  from the current set of checked out package sources.

  ## Known problems
  1. Given packages A, B, C, where C depends on B, and B depends on A,
  and you call

      rpmbuild-order sort C.spec A.spec

  then the output may be wrong if C does not have a direct dependency on A.
  Even if the order is correct, B is missing in the output
  and thus in this case the list of packages cannot be reliably used
  for a sequence of builds.

  However the `deps` and `rdeps` commands take
  other neighbouring package directories into account.

  2. repoquery is not used to resolve Requires or filelists for Provides.
  So if a package BuildRequires a file, it will not be resolved to a package.
  This may get addressed in a future version.
