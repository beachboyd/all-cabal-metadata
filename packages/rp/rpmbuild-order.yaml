description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juhp/rpmbuild-order.png)](https://travis-ci.org/juhp/rpmbuild-order)\n\n#
  rpmbuild-order\n\nThis package based on code from [cabal-sort](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-sort),
  sorts rpm package spec files by build order.\n\n    $ rpmbuild-order --help\n    $
  rpmbuild-order sort mycore mylib myapp\n    mylib\n    mycore\n    myapp\n\nThe
  arguments passed can either be directories named after the package, or spec files.\n\nBy
  default it outputs the package names, but it can also output\nthe spec filenames
  or directory paths for easier scripting.\n\nUsing the rpmbuild-order `deps` and
  `rdeps` commands the ordered\ndependencies and reverse dependencies of a package
  can be obtained\nfrom the current set of checked out package sources.\n\n## Known
  problems\nGiven packages A, B, C, where C depends on B, and B depends on A,\nand
  you call\n\n    rpmbuild-order C.spec A.spec\n\nthen the output may be wrong if
  C does not have a direct dependency on A.\nEven if the order is correct, B is missing
  in the output\nand thus in this case the list of packages cannot be reliably used\nfor
  a sequence of builds.\n\n"
