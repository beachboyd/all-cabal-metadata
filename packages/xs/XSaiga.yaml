description: ! 'This package contains a Haskell implementation of the X-SAIGA project''s
  parser combinators. The combinators

  enable fully-general attribute grammars to be implemented as executable specifications.
  Although the parser

  is top-down, and therefore highly modular, left-recursive productions are allowed
  and fully-general synthesized

  and inherited attribute dependencies are also allowed. The parse tree, which is
  decorated with attribute values,

  is built as a compact Tomita-style graph. Lazy evaluation enables attribute values
  to be evaluated only as needed.

  Time and space complexity are both O(n^4) where n is the length of the input. An
  example natural-language interface (called Solarman)

  to a semantic-web style RDF triplestore with approximately 3,000 facts about the
  solar system has been built

  as an executable specification of an attribute grammar. Solarman is included in
  this archive.

  Solarman computes answers to queries using an event-based denotational semantics
  which is based on Montague and Davidsonian semantics.

  A web site [3] has been created so that readers can enter queries and find out more
  about Solarman.
