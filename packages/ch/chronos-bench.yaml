  # Chronos

  `chronos` performs lazy benchmarking of shell commands with continuous feedback and improving precision.

  Please look at the documentation of the module for an overview of the api:
  [Html](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/chronos-bench/docs/Chronos.html)

  ## How does it work?

  `chronos` will benchmark the specified commands until you abort it
  with ctrl-c or it reaches some termination criterion specified by the
  command line.  It updates every iteration the measurements of the
  benchmarks so you can terminate it when you're satisfied with the
  presented precision.  It will intersperse all benchmarks for fastest
  possible overview and to distribute any external load over all
  benchmarks to improve precision.

  ## Options

  `chronos` presents rich command line options.

  You can as well use autocomplete of your shell with following command:
  ```bash
  source <(chronos --bash-completion-script `which chronos`)
  ```

  Normally, the output of `--bash-completion-script` should be coppied in the appropriate directory.

  ## Library

  You can use `chronos` as a haskell library to benchmark pure or impure functions or shell commands.

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Chronos

  main :: IO ()
  main = defaultMain
    [ bench "fib 1" fib 1
    , bench "fib 2" fib 2
    , bench "fib 4" fib 4
    , bench "fib 8" fib 8
    ]

  fib :: Int -> Int
  fib 1 = 1
  fib 2 = 1
  fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
  ```

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Chronos

  import Control.Concurrent
  import Data.IORef

  main :: IO ()
  main = defaultMain
    [ benchIO "ioref" (newIORef True)
    , benchIO "mvar"  (newMVar True)
    , benchIO "qsem"  (newQSem 5)
    , benchIO "chan"  (newChan :: IO (Chan Int))
    ]
  ```

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Chronos

  main :: IO ()
  main = defaultMain
    [ benchShell "sleep is slow"  "sleep 0"
    , benchShell "echo is fast"   "echo"
    , benchShell "true is faster" "true"
    ]
  ```

  ## Comparison

  Comparing `chronos` to `bench` and `hyperfine`:

  `chronos`
  - intersperses all benchmarks, therefore allowing you fast comparisons
  - uses scientific notation
  - is more robust to external loads because ouf the interspersing (it will affect all benchmarks and not only some)
  - uses a number of significant digits according to the current standard error (so with time more digits are presented and not always 4 which is often the wrong thing to do)
  - uses bars with confidence intervals on the command line for easy comparison

  Comparing `chronos` to `criterion`:

  `chronos`
  - has got a much simpler api
  - can be used in testsuites
  - has got much simpler internals
  - has got less dependencies
  - doesn't measure allocations
  - doesn't measure cpu time
