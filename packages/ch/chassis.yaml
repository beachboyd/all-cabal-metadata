  # chassis

  Chassis is an experimental prelude that exports most of the standard Haskell apparatus by default,
  common types and type classes, as well as lesser used abstractions from category theory by default.

  Chassis also re-exports some thins from vinyl and composite, and keeps polykinds on by default.

  Extremely early prototype idea.
