description: ! 'ChalkBoard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
  image generation and processing.

  The basic structure is a Chalk Board, a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically
  colors.

  ChalkBoard provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying, function
  mapping,

  cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more unusual ones.

  Images can be imported into ChalkBoard, as first-class color chalk boards.

  ChalkBoard also provides combinators for drawing shapes on directly on boards.

  The system is based loosely on Pan, but the principal image type, a Board, is abstract.'
