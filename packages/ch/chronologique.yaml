description: ! 'A simple type useful for representing timestamps as generated by system

  events, along with conveniences for converting between time types from common

  Haskell time libraries.


  Our original use was wanting to conveniently measure things happening on

  distributed computer systems. Since machine clock cycles are in units of

  nanoseconds, this has the nice property that, assuming the system clock is not

  corrupted, two subsequent events from the same source process are likely to

  have monotonically increasing timestamps. And even if the system clock has

  skew, they''re still decently likely to be unique per device. These TimeStamps

  thus make good keys when building Maps.


  The core type is in "Chrono.TimeStamp", see there for full documentation.'
