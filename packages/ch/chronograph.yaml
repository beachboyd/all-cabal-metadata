description: ! 'The ''Chronograph'' data structure adds a measure field

  to an existing Haskell expression.  This field will be the

  time necessary to evaluate the expression using an

  arbitrary evaluation strategy (WHNF by default).


  Chronograph preserves laziness, so that the work of

  performing the evaluation is only done after the result is

  demanded.


  If you want to benchmark your program, you should look to

  other packages like Criterion that perform statistical

  analysis of your results so you can determine how reliable

  they are.  Chronograph just takes measurements, leaving

  the interpretation entirely to you.'
