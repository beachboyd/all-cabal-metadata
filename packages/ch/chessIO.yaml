  chessIO -- A Haskell chess library and console UCI frontend program
  ===================================================================

  chessIO is a Haskell library for working with chess positions and moves, and a
  console frontend program (cboard) to work with UCI compatible chess engines.

  The Library
  -----------

  The main module provided by the library is Game.Chess_, which defines
  data types and functions for working with chess positions and moves.
  It offers a fully compliant move generator and parsing for and printing
  positions in `Forsyth-Edwards Notation`_ and moves in `Algebraic Notation`_.

  Module Game.Chess.UCI_ provides functionality to run an external process
  which understands the Universal Chess Interface protocol from within Haskell.

  cboard -- Console frontend for the Universal Chess Interface protocl
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  cboard is a simple console (text-mode) frontend for interacting with chess engines
  (like stockfish or glaurung) which make use of the UCI protocol.

  To launch a chess engine, simply pass its executable name and arguments
  to cboard.  For instance, `cboard stockfish`.
