description: ! 'Ott (<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/>) is a tool for

  writing formal definitions of programming

  languages and calculi.  Often the Ott grammars

  one defines end up being ambiguous, and Ott

  signals its displeasure by spewing forth several

  massive parse trees in a format requiring

  formidable patience to read.  Finding the slight

  differences between two such parse trees is an

  exercise in seizure-inducing tedium.


  To the rescue comes ottparse-pretty!  Simply

  paste in each parse and it is shown to you in a

  nicely formatted tree form with all the extra

  meaningless cruft removed.'
