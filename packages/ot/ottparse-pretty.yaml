description: |-
  Ott (<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/>) is a tool for
  writing formal definitions of programming
  languages and calculi.  Often the Ott grammars
  one defines end up being ambiguous, and Ott
  signals its displeasure by spewing forth several
  massive parse trees in a format requiring
  formidable patience to read.  Finding the slight
  differences between two such parse trees is an
  exercise in seizure-inducing tedium.

  To the rescue comes ottparse-pretty!  Simply
  paste in each parse and it is shown to you in a
  nicely formatted tree form with all the extra
  meaningless cruft removed.
