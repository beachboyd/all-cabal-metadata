description: ! "# EKG: Remote monitoring of running processes over HTTP\n\nThis library
  lets you remotely monitor a running process over HTTP.\nIt provides a simple way
  to integrate a monitoring server into any\napplication.\n\n# Getting started\n\nAdding
  monitoring to your application is simple.  Just launch the\nmonitoring server as
  soon as your application starts\n\n    import System.Remote.Monitoring.Wai\n    \n
  \   main = do\n         forkServer \"localhost\" 8000\n         ...\n\nand then
  visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in\nyour web browser.\n\nTo
  make full use out of this module you must first enable GC\nstatistics collection
  in the run-time system. To enable GC\nstatistics collection, either run your program
  with\n\n> +RTS -T\n\nor compile it with\n\n> -with-rtsopts=-T\n\nThe runtime overhead
  of `-T` is very small so it's safe to always\nleave it enabled.\n\n# JSON API\n\nThe
  monitoring server also lets you to retrieve the stats as JSON.\nSimply send the
  server an HTTP GET request with the Accept header set\nto \"application/json\":\n\n
  \   curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" http://localhost:8000/\n\nYou can use the
  JSON API to e.g. write applications that monitor other\napplications.\n\n# Get involved!\n\nPlease
  report bugs via the\n[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/tibbe/ekg/issues).\n\nMaster
  [git repository](https://github.com/tvh/ekg-wai):\n\n    git clone https://github.com/tvh/ekg-wai.git\n\n\n#
