description: ! '/Transf/ is simple text transformer and interpreter.


  It scans its input for guard tokens and passes everything between to transformation
  functions. Transformation functions are composed from a small set of combinators
  and may perform arbitrary Haskell computation. Transf contains a full Haskell interpreter
  and can even interpret its input as Haskell.


  The main purpose of Transf is to allow the embedding of Domain-Specific Languages
  in text or Markdown files.

  For example one could use it with Diagrams as follows:


  > This is my file. Here is an image:

  >

  > ~~~diagram "A circle!"

  > circle <> stretchX 2 square

  > ~~~


  Transf can then generate the image, and replace the source in the text file with
  the name of the actual image. It can also include the source.


  > This is my file. Here is an image:

  >

  > ![A circle](a22b15efb10b.png)

  >


  You can supply your own file names. In the above example, the file name is a hash
  of the source code.'
