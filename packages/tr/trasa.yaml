description: ! 'This library is a solution for http-based routing and dispatch. Its

  goals are similar to the goals of `servant`, however, `trasa` relies

  on very different mechanisms to accomplish those goals. All typeclasses

  in this library are optional. All of the real work is accomplished with GADTs,

  universal quantification, and plain old haskell data types.'
