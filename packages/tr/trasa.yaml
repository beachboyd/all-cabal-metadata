description: |-
  This library is a solution for http-based routing and dispatch. Its
  goals are similar to the goals of `servant`, however, `trasa` relies
  on very different mechanisms to accomplish those goals. All typeclasses
  in this library are optional. All of the real work is accomplished with GADTs,
  universal quantification, and plain old haskell data types.
