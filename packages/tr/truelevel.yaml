description: ! '# truelevel -- audio file compresor / limiter

  Copyright &copy; 2006-2014 Bart Massey


  This program is a simple command-line compressor / limiter

  for WAVE format audio files.  There is precious little

  documentation at this point; that needs to be fixed soon.


  I''m not really working on this Haskell code any longer; I

  rewrote it in Java for a project I''m working on.  However, I

  think it''s a nice demo app for my

  [WAVE library](http://github.com/BartMassey/WAVE).
