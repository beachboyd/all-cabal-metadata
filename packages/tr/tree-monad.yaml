description: ! 'Non-Determinism Monad for Tree Search

  =====================================


  This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type

  class that represents the search space as a tree whose constructors

  represent mzero, return, and mplus.


  Such a tree can be used to implement different search strategies,

  e.g., by using a queue. It can also be used as a basis for parallel

  search strategies that evaluate different parts of the search space

  concurrently.
