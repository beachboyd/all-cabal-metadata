description: ! 'Arbitrary data transformations that work at the level of single individual
  data

  can be safely applied before applying a differentially private data analysis if

  an adversary only gets to observe the result of the differentially private analysis.

  The current version of the PSI prototype offers support for writing variable

  transformations as R programs that can be run on the data before running

  the other private statistics. Arbitrary R programs can allow for leakage of

  information beyond the output, and "side-channel attacks" where an adversary

  observes this additional leakage and thereby undermines the privacy guarantees.

  TransformeR is a subset of the R language that can serve

  as a domain specifc language useful to write the needed data transformations and

  at the same time be more maneageable for preventing security weaknesses

  and side-channel attacks.'
