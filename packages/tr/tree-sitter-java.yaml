changelog: |
  # v0.7.0.0

  * move contents of internal library into library and remove internal library
  * add `getNodeTypesPath` to provide easier access to `node-types.json` file

  # v0.4.0.0

  * AST datatypes use a shared `Token` datatype for all anonymous leaves.
  * Bumps the lower bound on `tree-sitter` to 0.5.
  * AST named sum datatypes are represented as `newtype` wrappers around sums constructed with `:+:`.
  * AST named & anonymous sum types are represented as balanced binary trees of `:+:`s instead of right-chained lists.
  * Rename the `bytes` field of leaves to `text`.

  # v0.3.0.0

  * Adds AST datatypes in `TreeSitter.Java.AST` which you can use with `TreeSitter.Unmarshal`.
