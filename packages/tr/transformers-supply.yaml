description: ! 'The @Supply@ monad represents a computation that consumes values from
  a

  provided supply.


  This package comes with two separate implementations,

  @Control.Applicative.Supply@ and @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply@. The former

  provides an applicative and applicative transformer, the latter a monad and

  monad transformer.


  The reason for providing two separate implementations is that the

  @Applicative@ instance of @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply.SupplyT@ incurs a

  @Monad@ constraint on the wrapped type, meaning it''s not possible to

  (usefully) wrap a type that only has an @Applicative@ instance.


  The implementation of @Control.Applicative.Supply.SupplyT@ has an

  @Applicative@ instance for wrapped types that are only @Applicative@, but

  this implementation cannot be made an instance of @Monad@, meaning it is

  less powerful than the version from @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply@.


  In general, use @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply@ unless you''re wrapping a type

  that has no @Monad@ instance, in which case you can fall back to

  @Control.Applicative.Supply@.'
