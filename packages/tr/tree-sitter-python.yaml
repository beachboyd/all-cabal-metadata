changelog: |
  # v0.6.0.0

  * AST datatypes use a shared `Token` datatype for all anonymous leaves.
  * Bumps the lower bound on `tree-sitter` to 0.5.
  * AST named sum datatypes are represented as `newtype` wrappers around sums constructed with `:+:`.
  * AST named & anonymous sum types are represented as balanced binary trees of `:+:`s instead of right-chained lists.
  * Rename the `bytes` field of leaves to `text`.

  # v0.5.0.0

  * Bumps `tree-sitter` to `^>= 0.4`.

  # v0.4.0.0

  * Fixes a bug where comments were mistakenly being added to `extraChildren` fields. ([#204](https://github.com/tree-sitter/haskell-tree-sitter/pull/203))
  * Bumps to `tree-sitter-0.3.0.0`.

  # v0.3.0.0

  * Adds annotation fields to all generated data types. ([#181](https://github.com/tree-sitter/haskell-tree-sitter/pull/181))
  * Fixes bug where nodes would be inserted into fields in reverse order. ([#195](https://github.com/tree-sitter/haskell-tree-sitter/issues/195))
  * Pulled latest tree-sitter grammar.

  # v0.2.0.0

  * Adds `extraChildren` field to all applicable data types. ([#179](https://github.com/tree-sitter/haskell-tree-sitter/pull/179))

  # v0.1.0.0

  * Initial release.
