description: ! "mprover-0.0.0.0\n---------------\n\nThis is a highly preliminary release
  of MProver, a simple (I hope!) proof\nchecker for equational reasoning in (a subset
  of) Haskell. It is released\nin the spirit, though not under the exact terms, of
  the CRAPL[1].\n\nTo build and install, use the standard incantation, viz.:\n\n  $
  runhaskell Setup.hs configure\n  $ runhaskell Setup.hs build\n  $ runhaskell Setup.hs
  install\n\nTo launch the REPL (note that loading modules for use in the REPL is
  not\nsupported yet, so you may find this a bit useless):\n\n  $ mp\n\nTo run the
  proof checker against an example MProver script:\n\n  $ mp examples/Test.hs\n\nIf
  you have any questions or comments, please write:\n\n  Adam Procter <amp269@mail.missouri.edu>\n\nIn
  particular, I'd be glad to send you a draft copy of a conference paper,\ncurrently
  under review, that outlines MProver's design.\n\nEnjoy at your own risk!\n\n\nBugs/Limitations\n----------------\n\nSome
  particular bugs/limitations/to-do items of note:\n\n  * The guardedness check is
  not implemented yet.\n  * Program terms are not type checked (!)\n  * Type classes
  are not implemented yet.\n  * Case-proofs must be exhaustive; this is not actually
  checked for yet.\n\n---\n\n[1]  http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/\n"
