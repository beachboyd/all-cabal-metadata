  # wshterm

  `wshterm` is a terminal emulator for the browser.

  `wshterm` combines hterm with a backend application to provide a terminal
  emulator for the browser. Communication is done via websockets.

  ## Features

  * Runs most CLI and TUI programs (haven't found one that didn't work yet)
  * Ability to display images using the iTerm inline image escape sequences
  * Supports resizing the terminal
  * Run an arbitary command on connection.

  It currently does not support SSL, it is currently expected that if you
  need SSL, you will put it behind a reverse proxy such as NGINX.

  It currently does not drop priveleges. Don't run it as `root`. Use the
  provided `ssh_local` script if you want to authenticate.

  ## Usage

  Simply run as the user you want to run as, and specify a command to be
  executed.

      sudo -u nobody wshterm ./ssh_local
