description: "# Breve\n### a url shortener\n\nBreve is a web application that provides
  a simple interface to\nshortening long urls creating links smaller and easier to
  remember.\n\nYou can find a running instance on [brve.bit](https://brve.bit)\n\nIt
  creates links in the form of \"/emeaoinqua\": easier to remember than\nalphanumeric
  strings like \"/1Cqw8lHw\" used by several services.\n\nIt was inspired by [hastebin](http://hastebin.com).\n\n##
  Installing\n\nInstall the app with cabal-install. Run\n\n    $ cabal install breve\n\nand
  start it with\n\t\n    $ breve\n\nThe app will start serving on `https://localhost:3000`,
  listening on every active interface.\n\n## Configure\n\nYou can change the options
  by editing the config file.\nWhen you start the app an empty one will be created
  in:\n`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/breve`, `~/.config/breve` if unset,\nor you can pass a path
  as the first argument of breve.\n\nThe default values are:\n\n```ini\nhostname =
  \"localhost\"\nport     = 3000\nbaseurl  = \"https://localhost:3000/\"\nurltable
  = \"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/breve\"\ntls {\n  cert  = \"/usr/share/tls/breve.crt\"\n  key
  \  = \"/usr/share/tls/breve.key\"\n  chain = []\n}\n```\n\n`urltable` is the location
  of breve url hashtable\n\n`chain` is a list of chain certificate files\n\n## License\n\nCopyright
