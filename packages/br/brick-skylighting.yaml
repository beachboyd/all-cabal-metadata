synopsis: Show syntax-highlighted text in your Brick UI
changelog: ! "# Revision history for brick-skylighting\n\n0.3\n===\n\n * Increased
  Vty lower bound to 5.23.1 to support italics.\n * Skylighting token styles that
  used italics now translate to the Vty\n   italics style rather than the standout
  style.\n\n0.2\n===\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added `Brick.Widgets.Skylighting.highlightFromMap`
  to highlight text by\n   looking up syntax names in a Skylighting `SyntaxMap.\n
  * Removed `Brick.Widgets.Skylighting.simpleHighlight` because we no\n   longer have
  access to the bundled `SyntaxMap` of default entries in\n   the `skylighting` package.\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * This now depends on `skylighting-core` (BSD), not `skylighting`\n   (GPL),
  to avoid inadvertent compilation of a GPL depdendency:\n\n   To ensure that users
  of this library do not inadvertently pull in a\n   dependency on a GPL'd library
  (skylighting), this package uses and\n   depends only on the new skylighting-core
  package, a BSD-compatible\n   subset of the skylighting functionality. The main
  thing we give\n   up in doing this is generated Haskell modules that provide syntax\n
  \  definitions embedded in the program. Consequently users of this\n   library must
  load the syntax definitions themselves and provide them\n   to this library's functions.
  (skylighting could be used for that\n   if desired, but we no longer force users
  to do so.) Please see the\n   README for notes on how to deal with this.\n\n0.1\n===\n\nFirst
  version.\n"

description: ! "\nbrick-skylighting\n=================\n\n![](images/demo.png)\n\nThis
  package extends the [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick)\nlibrary with
  syntax highlighting support using the\n[Skylighting](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting)
  library.\n\nSee the Haddock documentation for `Brick.Widgets.Skylighting` for API\ndetails,
  and see the demonstration program in `programs` for a complete\nworking example.\n\nNote:
  this library requires its users to provide syntax highlighting\ndefinitions. For
  that, there are two choices:\n\n * Obtain XML specifications from e.g. the `skylighting-core`
  sources,\n   then bundle these with your program files. Those files are\n   GPL-licensed,
  so this option is preferable when you want to ship\n   these GPL-licensed files
  with your program without the GPL infecting\n   the license of your application.\n\n
  * Use the compiled-in syntax specifications in the `skylighting`\n   package. This
  option is preferable if you are okay with a\n   GPL-licensed dependency (i.e. if
  your application is also GPL'd) and\n   you especially want to avoid having to bundle
  the XML files with your\n   application or avoid the runtime loading of such files.\n"
