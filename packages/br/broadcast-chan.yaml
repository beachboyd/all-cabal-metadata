  A closable, fair, single-wakeup channel that avoids the 0 reader space leak
  that `Control.Concurrent.Chan` from base suffers from.

  The `Chan` type from `Control.Concurrent.Chan` consists of both a read and
  write end combined into a single value. This means there is always at least 1
  read end for a `Chan`, which keeps any values written to it alive. This is a
  problem for applications/libraries that want to have a channel that can have
  zero listeners.

  Suppose we have an library that produces events and we want to let users
  register to receive events. If we use a channel and write all events to it, we
  would like to drop and garbage collect any events that take place when there
  are 0 listeners. The always present read end of `Chan` from base makes this
  impossible. We end up with a `Chan` that forever accumulates more and more
  events that will never get removed, resulting in a memory leak.

  `BroadcastChan` splits channels into separate read and write ends. Any message
  written to a a channel with no existing read end is immediately dropped so it
  can be garbage collected. Once a read end is created, all messages written to
  the channel will be accessible to that read end.

  Once all read ends for a channel have disappeared and been garbage collected,
  the channel will return to dropping messages as soon as they are written.

  Why should I use `BroadcastChan` over `Control.Concurrent.Chan`?
  ---
  * `BroadcastChan` is closable,
  * `BroadcastChan` has no 0 reader space leak,
  * `BroadcastChan` has comparable or better performance.

  Why should I use `BroadcastChan` over various (closable) STM channels?
  ---
  * `BroadcastChan` is single-wakeup,
  * `BroadcastChan` is fair,
  * `BroadcastChan` performs better under contention.
