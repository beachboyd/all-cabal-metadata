description: ! 'This is a direct implementation of the operational semantics and is
  by no

  means fast, or a substitute for a real interpreter. Programs run with this

  evaluator will have an asymptotic complexity much worse than if they were

  compiled. This evaluator is intended for experimenting with the language

  semantics, and not running actual programs.'
