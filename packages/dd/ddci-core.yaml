description: ! 'Disciple Core is an explicitly typed language based on System-F2,
  intended

  as an intermediate representation for a compiler. In addition to the features of

  System-F2 it supports region, effect and closure typing. Evaluation order is

  left-to-right call-by-value by default, but explicit lazy evaluation is also supported.

  There is also a capability system to track whether objects are mutable or constant,

  and to ensure that computations that perform visible side effects are not suspended
  with

  lazy evaluation.'
