  ##  hmp3-ng

  The `hmp3` music player, written in Haskell, dates to 2005, and has a
  curses-based interface which can be used in an ordinary text terminal.
  But it has become abandonware: the last update was in June 2008,
  and it no longer builds with today's Haskell and standard libraries.

  This repository is a work in progress to resurrect this software.

  The original Darcs repo has vanished from the Internet.  However, I
  have a copy I checked out in 2008 (to hack on!) with all the patches
  through version 1.5.1 (the latest is 1.5.2.1, which I had at one point
  but cannot find), and Hackage hosts tarballs for several versions.

  *  I used [darcs-to-git](https://github.com/purcell/darcs-to-git)
  to port to Git.

  *  I added commits for the changes in the two later published versions.
  These were fairly small, the bulk being the regeneration of the
  `configure` file using a newer version of GNU `autoconf`.

  *  I updated the code to compile under modern GHC (8.6.5 as of this
  writing) and libraries.  Some code could not be directly ported,
  mainly low-level optimizations, and so was replaced.

  *  There is a Github issue tracker to cover other problems and
  planned changes.

  *  I have added support for building with Stack.

  *  All C code is removed.  There is still some use of the FFI.

  *  Work on other features and changes, and documentation, is ongoing.

  I have also made a few changes and additions to the key bindings per
  my preference.

  I am still working out the flaws.  Let me know if there are problems.


  ##  Installation

  Either `cabal install` or `stack install` will build a binary.
  You will need to have `mpg123` installed, which is free software and
  widely available in package managers.  Although `mpg321` could also
  be used, support is currently poor.

  The build depends on the package `hscurses`, which in turn requires
  curses dev files.  In Ubuntu/Debian, for example, these can be gotten
  by installing `libncurses5-dev`.


  ##  Use

  The `hmp3` executable is called with arguments containing a list of mp3
  files or directories of mp3 files.  With no arguments, it will use the
  playlist from the last time it was run, which is stored in `~/.hmp3db`.

  ```
  $ hmp3 ~/Music ~/Downloads/La-La.mp3
  $ hmp3
  ```

  Once running, `hmp3` is controlled by fairly intuitive key commands.
  `h` shows a help menu, and `q` quits.

  A color scheme can be specified by writing out a `Config { .. }`
  value in `~/.hmp3`.  See `Style.hs` for the definition.  The `l`
  command reloads this configuration.
