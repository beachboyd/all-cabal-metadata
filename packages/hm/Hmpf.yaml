description: ! 'Description:


  Hmpf is an MPD client designed to play music on a Home Theatre PC.

  The PC should have an infrared remote and VDU display.


  Hmpf allows a large music collection to be browsed with a standard remote.

  It also contains a LastFM client to update your listening history to the LastFM

  servers. Finally, as a last touch Hmpf is able to dynamically generate new entries

  for a playlist based on style of tracks already selected.


  Dependencies:


  Hmpf relies on a running MPD server, LIRC and LCDProc.


  Configuration:


  Hmpf is configured by a configuration file that is expected to be place at /etc/hmpf.conf

  Look at the sample configuration for more details.


  To Do:


  Hmpf works nicely for me and seems fairly robust. However, more documentation

  of the source files is required. The  code which manages the display also

  assumes a 2 x 16 display window. Finally, the way the input code is organised

  it is fairly specific to the LIRC configuration I have chosen for my reomte. If

  any interest is shown in the application I might rectify these shortcomings.



  Hope you enjoy it.
