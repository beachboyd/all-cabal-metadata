description: ! 'This library provides a quick-and-dirty (but often effective)

  method for extending Haskell''s syntax using a custom

  preprocessor.  It parses Haskell into a bare-bones AST with just

  enough knowledge of the syntax to preserve nesting, and then

  allows transformations on the AST.


  See the package ixdopp

  (<http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/ixdopp>)

  for an example of how to do this.'
