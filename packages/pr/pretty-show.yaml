synopsis: ! 'Tools for working with derived `Show` instances and generic

  inspection of values.'
changelog: ! "Changes in 1.9.1\n  * Allow keywords as the name of constructors\n\nChanges
  in 1.9\n  * Add support for pre-processing values before printing.\n    In particular,
  we add a pre-processor which will hide some constructors\n    from the output.\n\nChanges
  in 1.8.2\n  * Switch to using version 3.3.1 of jquery (jquery 1 seems to be long
  gone)\n\nChanges in 1.8\n  * Rejigger the rendering of unusal values, to improve
  the rendering of datres.\n    - a sequence of values with negative numbers is turned
  into an infix con\n    - change the association when sequences meet infix things\n\nChanges
  in 1.7\n  * Add a dependency on package Text\n    - Adds an instance for `PrettyVal
  Text`\n    - Paves the road for using `Text` in the representation of values.\n\nChanges
  in 1.6.16\n  * Fixes to accomodate GHC 8.4\n\nChanges in 1.6.13\n  * Parse things
  like <function> and <Function> as constructors\n\nChanges in 1.6.12\n  * Treat reserved
  operators as infix constructors (best effort kind of thing)\n\nChanges in 1.6.11\n
  \ * Add `pPrint`, which is `putStrLn . ppShow`\n\nChanges in 1.6.10\n  * Increase
  the precedence of unary minus\n\nChanges in 1.6.9\n  * Relax parsing of atoms, so
  that we can support things like the show\n    instance of StdGen (e.g., [ 123 45,
  786 10 ])\n\nChanges in 1.6.8.2:\n  * Correct license in srouce files.\n\nChanges
  in 1.6.8.1:\n  * Correct the 'License' field in the Cabal file to match the license
  (MIT)\n\nChanges in 1.6.8:\n  * Move source-repository pragma to top-level.\n\nChanges
  in 1.6.5:\n  * Rename CHANGES to CHANGELOG to work with hackage.\n\nChanges in 1.6.4:\n
  \ * Drop dependency on happy >= 1.19\n\nChanges in 1.6.3:\n  * Add Safe Haskell
  annotations\n  * Add CHANGES file\n  * Add generated parser to package again.  We
  do this, because otherwise\n    the package fails to build on systems that do not
  have `happy`.\n    This is a bit questionable, but hopefully it won't be too much
  of\n    a problem.\n"

description: ! 'We provide a library and an executable for working with derived ''Show''

  instances. By using the library, we can parse derived ''Show'' instances into a

  generic data structure. The @ppsh@ tool uses the library to produce

  human-readable versions of ''Show'' instances, which can be quite handy for

  debugging Haskell programs.  We can also render complex generic values into

  an interactive Html page, for easier examination.'
