description: ! 'This package helps you to write code that works with GHC before 7.10

  and starting with 7.10.

  It provides the content of the "Prelude2010" module as "Prelude".

  This way you can replace a dependency on @base@ by


  > Build-Depends: base-noprelude ==4.*, prelude2010 ==0.*


  in your Cabal file and you do not have to alter modules.


  Attention:

  While this works for package builds,

  GHCi will complain about conflicting Prelude modules.

  After installation of this package, you should run


  > $ ghc-pkg hide prelude2010'
