synopsis: ANSI terminal backend for the »prettyprinter« package.
changelog: ! "# 1.1.1.2\n\n- Fix documentation claiming there would be a trailing
  newline in `renderIO`\n  when there is none\n\n# 1.1.1.1\n\n- `renderIO` now renders
  directly to STDOUT, instead of first building a textual\n  rendering and then printing
  that to STDOUT.\n\n# 1.1.1\n\n- Expose `AnsiStyle`’s constructors for adaptability\n\n#
  1.1\n\n- Overhauled the API significantly – Styles are now combined using the\n
  \ `Semigroup` instance from a number of readable primitives.\n\n# 1.0.1\n\nFix version
  shenanigans, since the prerelease was released to Hackage as version\n1 already,
  so uploading the »new« version 1 did not work\n\n# 1\n\nInitial release\n"
