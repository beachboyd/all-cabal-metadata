  title: Prosidy README

  Prosidy is a small language for writing documents.

  Like #link[uri='https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/']{Markdown},
  Prosidy's syntax is lightweight; it doesn't get in the way of your text.

  Like #link[uri='https://www.w3.org/XML/']{XML},
  Prosidy is extensible: it doesn't make any assumptions about your content.
  You'll never have to fight to make your data fit a structure that wasn't designed for it.

  #=src[lang='prosidy']:end
  recipe: A simple roux
  ---
  In a #ware{medium saucepan},
  heat #ingredient[amount='25', unit='g']{oil}
  until dropping a pinch of flour into the oil causes it to bubble.

  #ware{Whisk} #ingredient[amount='25', unit='g']{flour}
  into the oil until the roux is the desired color.
  #:end

  All of the code here is under #b{heavy} development;
  be careful before using it for anything critical!

  That said, feedback is more than welcome!

  #-h{Developing Prosidy}
  This project sets up an environment using direnv and Nix.
  We'd recommend you have both installed before building,
  although it may work without both.
