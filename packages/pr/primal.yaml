  # primal

  **Warning** - it is still in experimental stage.

  This package attempts to combine best practices from Haskell eco-system on how to deal
  with `RealWorld`, `IO` and `ST`. It also provides quite a few primitive operations through
  FFI and C that are either not available in older GHC or not available at all.

  Unique functionality for unpacking complex types as well as atomic modification of such
  values.
