description: ! 'Any @MVar@ or other concurrency primitive can be read by or written
  to any

  function which recieves it as a value. This package provides read-only and

  write-only versions of @Chan@, @MVar@, @TChan@, @TMVar@, and @TVar@.

  Functions which use these versions receive permission to read, write, or

  both based on their type signatures.'
