description: ! 'This package provides a "Prelude" module drop-in replacement for [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base)''s
  @Prelude@ module.


  Goals of this package include:


  * Be reasonably modest and remain close in spirit to the @base@ package''s scope


  * Depend only on @base@ (via @base-noprelude@) for recent GHC versions


  * Avoid partial functions being in scope by default; redefine common partial functions
  such as @read@ or @head@ to be ''Maybe''-valued


  * Provide a uniform "Prelude" across multiple GHC releases (currently GHC 7.0 and
  newer supported) to the extent possible given typeclass restructurings such as AMP
  or FTP


  * Reduce @import@ clutter by reexporting common verbs from modules such as @Control.Monad@
  and @Control.Applicative@


  === Versioning and Usage


  This package is intended to be used in combination with [base-noprelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-noprelude)
  and

  possibly [base-orphans](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-orphans). @Prelude@
  strives to be faithful to

  the [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/); however, for technical reasons @Prelude@''s
  API is not fully determined by its version due to changes in core typeclasses and
  consequently it''s strongly advised to declare a dependency on @Prelude@ always
  in conjunction with a dependency on @base-noprelude@.


  For instance, all you need to do in order to use this package if you were previously
  depending on [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) via


  > build-depends:

  >     base ^>= 4.10.0.0 || ^>= 4.11.0.0


  is to replace @base@ by @base-noprelude@ and also add a dependency on @Prelude@
  like so


  > build-depends:

  >     Prelude ^>= 0.1.0.0

  >   , base-noprelude ^>= 4.10.0.0 || ^>= 4.11.0.0


  and this will effectively replace the implicit "Prelude" module.'
