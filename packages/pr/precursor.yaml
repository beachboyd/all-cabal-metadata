description: ! 'Features


  [No more ''String'']

  ''String'' is removed in favor of lazy ''Data.Text.Lazy.Text''.


  [No more ''Num'']

  The ''Num'' typeclass is now just for types which can be converted from

  integer literals.


  [''Semigroup''s]

  ''Semigroup''s are now in scope by default, as well as some useful

  wrappers.


  [''Semiring''s]

  A ''Semiring'' has the operations ''+'' and ''*'', and the members ''one''

  and ''zero''. ''Bool'' is a ''Semiring'', as is ''Integer'', etc. ''Num'' is

  /not/ a superclass of ''Semiring''.


  [Sensibly strict]

  Several functions, such as ''foldl'', ''sum'', ''product'', etc. are strict

  as default.


  [No unnecessary ''Monad''s]

  Functions such as ''Control.Monad.sequence'', ''Control.Monad.>>'', and

  ''Control.Monad.replicateM'' are removed in favor of the equivalent

  ''sequenceA'', ''*>'', and ''replicateA'' on ''Applicative''s.


  [Fewer partial functions]

  Functions like ''head'', ''last'', ''minimum'', etc. now return ''Nothing''

  when called on empty structures. ''tail'' and ''init'' return empty

  lists when called on empty lists.


  [Data structures]

  ''Map'' and ''Set'' (the strict variants) are now in scope by default,

  with a minimal, non-colliding aliased api.


  [Transformers]

  ''State'' is now in scope by default.


  [Debugging]

  Handy functions like ''trace'', ''traceShow'', and ''notImplemented'' are

  in scope by default. They give warnings when used so they can''t be

  forgotten.


  [Other handy functions]

  An /O(n*log n)/ ''nub'', ''foldr2'', ''converge'', ''bool'', and others.'
