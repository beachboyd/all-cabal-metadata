description: ! 'Summarize API differences between revisions of Cabal packages.


  Precis library is BSD3, Precis executable is LGPL apropos

  the dependency on CppHs.


  NOTE for version 0.5.0 - the next version is likely to have

  substantial changes. Version 0.5.0 does have a better strategy

  to resolve conditional modules, but otherwise it is not a

  compelling upgrade. If you have 0.4.0 installed, I recommend

  you skip this revision and wait for the next version.


  CHANGES

  0.4.0 to 0.5.0


  * Major re-organization. Module-to-file resolution substantially

  changed. Should be better for Cabal fines that use condition

  variables.


  0.3.1 to 0.4.0


  * Substantial changes to reporting - now a summary is printed

  to the console, and an HTML report can be generated via a

  command line flag.


  * Changed constructor names for Edit data type
