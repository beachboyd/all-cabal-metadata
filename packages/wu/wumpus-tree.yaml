synopsis: Drawing trees
changelog: ! "0.14.0 to 0.15.0:\n\n  * Updated to work with latest Wumpus libraries.
  \n    @ScalingContext@ has been temporarily added from Wumpus-Basic \n    (it was
  considered obsolete there). At some point the \n    functionality needs re-implementing
  so it can be removed from \n    Tree.\n  \n0.13.0 to 0.14.0:\n\n  * Updated to work
  with latest Wumpus libraries. \n\n0.12.0 to 0.13.0:\n\n  * Changed the specification
  of trees so that they are built in a\n    monad. The bind operation of the monad
  allows /anchors/ to be \n    extracted from tree nodes so they can be annotated
  with \n    supplementary graphics. At the moment this is rather limited \n    as
  Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Drawing do not offer much support \n    for anchors other
  than the basic type classes.\n\n  * Changed the type of the rendering functions
  so they produce a \n    TreeDrawing. This type is more suitable for building composite\n
  \   pictures than the previous type TreePicture. \n\n  * Also the rendering functions
  now take a start point for the \n    root node, again this should be more convenient
  for drawing \n    composite pictures - see the demo which now draws all the \n    example
  trees on one page.\n\n  * Internally the tree design is now more flexible - trees
  can be \n    designed upwards or leftwards rightwards, rather than just \n    downwards;
  and edge drawing style is lifted out of the \n    rendering to use a supplied combinator.
  Currently these \n    features are not exposed by the API, the API needs more \n
  \   thought (possibly warranting changes to Wumpus-Basic and \n    Wumpus-Drawing).\n\n\n0.11.1
  to 0.12.0:\n\n  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.\n \n\n0.11.0
  to 0.11.1:\n\n  * Removed unused @InnerSpace@ constriant on functions in \n    @Wumpus.Tree.Draw@.\n\n0.10.0
  to 0.11.0:\n\n  * Changed types of drawing functions so they can be run with \n
  \   glyph metrics (read from file in the IO monad). \n\n  * Generalized the unit
  type of the /design/ functions to some \n    numeric @u@ rather than Double.\n\n
  \ * The demo has been duplicated - one version uses GhostScript \n    glyph metrics
  and the other Adobe glyph metrics, as the \n    metrics are in different formats
  and need different font \n    loaders from Wumpus-Basic.\n  \n0.9.0 to 0.10.0:\n\n
  \ * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.\n\n0.8.0 to 0.9.0:\n\n  *
  Stopped re-exporting @DrawingContext@ from Wumpus-Basic in \n    the module Wumpus.Tree.
  Clients must now import \n    @Wumpus.Basic.Graphic@ to get the @DrawingContext@
  type and \n    the constructor @StandardContext@.\n\n  * Internal changes to track
  updates to Wumpus-Basic.\n \n0.7.0 to 0.8.0:\n\n  * Changed drawTreePicture to use
  the @ScalingContext@ datatype\n    from Wumpus.Basic. The type @ScaleFactors@ is
  now a type\n    synonym for @SalingContext@ operation on all Doubles. \n \n  * Added
  an alternative drawing style /family tree/.\n \n0.6.0 to 0.7.0:\n \n  * More example
  trees in Demo01.hs.\n\n  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic.\n\n0.5.0 to
  0.6.0:\n \n  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic.\n\n0.4.0 to 0.5.0:\n\n
  \ * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic. Nothing new.\n\n0.3.0 to 0.4.0:\n\n
  \ * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic. Nothing new.\n\n\n0.2.0 to 0.3.0\n\n
  \ * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic. No new \n    functionality.\n\n0.1.0
  to 0.2.0:\n\n  * Changed internals to use ConsDrawing monad as Wumpus-Basic\n    has
  changed.\n\n  * Internal change to use AGraphic rather than MGraphicF \n\n0.1.0:\n\n
  \ * First release.\n"

  Tree drawing with /nice/ layout.


  Draw trees represented by Data.Tree, output SVG or EPS. The

  output should be quite good - no overlapping edges, identical

  subtrees should have the same shape, leaf nodes evenly spaced.


  Note - the demos now use font metrics. Font metrics for the

  \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ files

  with GhostScript (AFM file version 2.0 for GhostScript 8.63) or

  available from Adode (AFM file version 4.1). To run the demos

  properly you will need one of these sets of metrics.

  \*\* WARNING \*\* - the API is unstable and will change.


  Changelog:


  v0.19.0 to v0.20.0:


  * Updates to work with wumpus-drawing-0.9.0 and

  wumpus-basic-0.24.0.


  v0.18.0 to v0.19.0:


  * Updated to work with Wumpus-Basic-0.22.0 and

  wumpus-drawing-0.7.0.


  v0.17.0 to v0.18.0:


  * Updated to work with Wumpus-Basic-0.22.0 and

  wumpus-drawing-0.7.0.


  v0.16.0 to v0.17.0:


  * Reworked internals to use the @LocDrawing@ monad from

  Wumpus-Basic.


  v0.15.0 to v0.16.0:


  * Re-worked so tree drawings form a @LocGraphic@ rather than a

  @TraceDrawing@, this makes more in line with other graphic

  objects in Wumpus like shapes.


  * Changed node type to be any @LocImage@ where the answer

  supports anchors.
