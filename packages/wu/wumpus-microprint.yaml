description: ! '

  A library to produce /microprints/ [1] sometimes known as

  \"greek-text\".


  A rudimentary tokenizer is provided, but it is largely

  untested.


  \*\* WARNING \*\* - in future, this library might not be updated

  to track revisions to Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Drawing.

  Originally microprints seemed like a simple subject to use as a

  testbed for developing Wumpus, however in practice the

  Microprint library has not been valuable for this. To do the

  subject justice, more effort has to be spent on tokenizing

  (which does not contribute to advancing Wumpus) than drawing.

  Eventually I intend to polish this library, but I do not expect

  to do this soon.

  Changelog:


  v0.13.0 to v0.14.0:


  * Updated to track changes to Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Drawing.


  * Removed the shim module @Wumpus.Microprint@ this was

  prioritizing the Teletype drawing style, however this style

  is now out-of-date and it may be dropped in future revisions

  rather than revised.


  v0.12.0 to v0.13.0:


  * Updated to track changes to Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Core.
