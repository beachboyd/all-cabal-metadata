synopsis: Type, render and parse the df1 hierarchical structured log format
changelog: ! "# Version 0.3\n\n* The `segment`, `key`, `value` and `message` functions
  are now methods of the\n  new `ToSegment`, `ToKey`, `ToValue` and `ToMessage` classes.
  \ Identity\n  instances, as well as instances for `String`, lazy `Text` and strict
  `Text`,\n  have been introduced for these classes.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: `Segment`, `Key`, `Value` and `Message` don't strip\n  surrounding whitespace
  anymore. When rendering `Segment`, `Key` and `Value`,\n  the whitespace will be
  percent-encoded. When rendering `Message`, the\n  whitespace will be kept as is.\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: `Segment` and `Key` now wrap lazy `Text`, rather than strict\n
  \ `Text`. This is to align their APIs with `Value` and `Message`, which already\n
  \ wrapped lazy `Text` so as to prevent logged `Value`s and `Message`s from\n  to
  use much memory. It's unlikely that `Segment`s and `Key`s are affected by\n  this,
  since in practice they are almost always created statically. So, this\n  change
  is mostly to make the API less surprising to users: Lazy `Text` is used\n  throughout.\n\n*
  Added draft BNF specification.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.2\n\n* Fixed escaping of control
  characters in `Message`.\n\n* Percent-escape less punctuation characters when rendering
  `Key`,\n  `Segment` and `Value`.\n\n  TODO: write spec.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.1\n\n*
  Fixed compilation.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n* Consider this a preview release: The
  API is likely to stay stable, but\n  extensive testing, formalization and tooling
  is due.\n"

description: ! '# df1


  Hierarchical structured logging format. Easy for humans, fast for computers.


  This library provides types, parsers and renderers for `df1`.


  Consider this a preview release: The API is likely to stay stable, but extensive

  testing, formalization and tooling is due.
