description: ! "\nINTRO\n\nnano-hmac follows in the footsteps of dons' nano-md5 library
  in an attempt\nto create a minimal library that provides access to the HMAC capability\nof
  OpenSSL.\n\nThe intent of the library is to be focused just on HMAC.\n\nIt is a
  working release and does pass the tests outlined in RFC's 2104 and 2202.\n\n\nINSTALL\n\n
  \ % runhaskell Setup.lhs configure\n  % runhaskell Setup.lhs build\n  % runhaskell
  Setup.lhs haddock\n  % sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install\n\n\nNOTES\n\nYou may encounter
  problems building the documentation if you're using\na version of haddock before
  version 2.0.0.0.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nMany good ideas regarding implementation
  and testing have been borrowed\nfrom Don Stewart's (dons) nano-md5 library.  Anything
  that is buggy or\ndoesn't make sense would be my own unique contribution.\n\n"
