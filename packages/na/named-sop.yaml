synopsis: Dependently-typed sums and products, tagged by field name
changelog: |
  # 0.2.0.0

  - Made NMap and NSum polymorphic over the kind of the key.  (Perhaps
    'Natural' keys would be useful as well.)  This is a breaking API
    change, because the qualifier for the kind of the key must go before
    the qualifier for the typelevel lists, potentially breaking
    TypeApplication uses.
  - Add Eq and Ord instances for NMap and NSum
  - Add a testsuite

  # 0.1.0.1

  Quickfix for an oversight in the `uninsertSum` function that broke
  `splitSum`.

  # 0.1.0.0

  Initial release.  Expect the public-facing API to change as the
  library is reworked.
