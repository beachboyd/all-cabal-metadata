description: ! 'The built-in comparisons for textual data are based on Unicode ordinals.
  This

  does not match most every-day sorting algorithms. For example,

  \"z10.txt\" is sorted after \"z2.txt\" by users, but before it by

  na&#239;ve algorithms.


  This package provides an implementation of \"natural sort\", which more

  closely matches user expectations.
