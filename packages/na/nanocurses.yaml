description: ! 'This is a simple binding to the Curses library, a common

  Unix library which allows you to use a terminal as a

  canvas on which your paint are characters (instead of line

  by line output); Curses is probably most useful for rogue-like

  interfaces.


  Nanocurses differs from Hscurses and Mage in that it is

  intended to be portable to Curses libraries other than Ncurses, such

  as Ocurses, Irix''s curses, and so on. So it may not have all their features.

  (It does not differ significantly from Hmp3''s Curses binding, as the Curses.hsc

  in Nanocurses is essentially extracted from Hmp3.)'
