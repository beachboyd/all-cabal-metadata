  # NaCl (`haskell-NaCl`)

  Easy-and-safe-to-use library for cryptography.

  **Note: this package is experimental and WIP.**

  Cryptography is hard to do right and you should never try to implement it
  on your own, even if you have access to safe and secure cryptographic
  primitives. Luckily, D. J. Bernstein created [NaCl].

  NaCl was designed specifically to make it hard to use it incorrectly and
  thus save your from a disaster. It exposes high-level cryptographic
  algorithms with underlying implementations chosen for you, so you do not
  get flexibility, but you get security, which is more important.

  [Sodium] is a reimplementation of NaCl with the goal to make it more
  portable across different platforms. With time, it started providing
  not only the same interface as NaCl, the developers of Sodium decided
  to add new primitives too.

  Sodium is more portable, but some people are afraid of using it,
  and prefer to stick to NaCl. We agree that it is better to be
  paranoid than sorry. That is why, even though this library uses
  Sodium under the hood, it only exposes the primitives that
  are part of the “classic” NaCl interface.
