description: ! "`hdaemonize`\n=================\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greydot/hdaemonize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greydot/hdaemonize)\n\n`hdaemonize`
  is a simple library that hides some of the complexities\nof writing UNIX daemons
  in Haskell.\n\nObtaining\n-----------\n\nThe latest version is available (BSD license)
  at\n[GitHub](https://github.com/greydot/hdaemonize).\n\nUsing\n-------\n\nThe synopsis
  is:\n\n    import System.Posix.Daemonize\n    main = daemonize $ program\n\nThis
  code will make `program` do what good daemons should do, that is,\ndetach from the
  terminal, close file descriptors, create a new process\ngroup, and so on.\n\nIf
  you want more functionality than that, it is available as a\n`serviced` function.\n\nHere
  is an example:\n\n    import Control.Concurrent\n    import System.Posix.Daemonize\n\n
  \   loop i log = do threadDelay $ 10^6\n                    log (show i)\n            \t
  \   writeFile \"/tmp/counter\" $ show i\n                    if i == 5 then undefined
  else loop (i + 1) log\n\n    main = serviced (loop 0)\n\nLet us say this program
  is compiled as `mydaemon`. Then:\n\n    # mydaemon start\n\nstarts the service.
  A second call to start will complain that the\nprogram is already running.\n\nDuring
  its execution, mydaemon will simply write a new number to\n`/tmp/counter` every
  second, until it reaches 5. Then, an exception\nwill be thrown. This exception will
  be caught by `hdaemonize`, and\nlogged to `/var/log/daemon.log` or similar (this
  is depends on how\n`syslog` works on your platorm).  `log (show i)` will leave messages\nin
  the same file.\n\nWhen the exception is thrown, the program will be restared in
  5\nseconds, and will start counting from 0 again.\n\nThe following commands are
  also made available:\n\n    # mydaemon stop\n    # mydaemon restart\n\nFinally,
  `mydaemon` drops privileges.  By default it changes the\neffective user and group
  ids to those of the `daemon` user, but it\nprefers to use those of `mydaemon`, if
  present.\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n* 0.5.4\n    * Update to use hsyslog == 5.\n\n*
  0.5.2\n    * Fix pre-AMP builds.\n\n* 0.5.1\n    * Updated to use hsyslog >=4\n\n*
  0.4\n    * added support for a privileged action before dropping privileges\n\n*
  0.3\n    * merged with updates by madhadron\n\n* 0.2\n    * provided documentation\n
  \   * backported to older GHC versions, tested on 6.8.1\n\n* 0.1\n    * initial
  public release\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\nLana Black <lanablack@amok.cc>\n\nAnton Tayanovskyy
