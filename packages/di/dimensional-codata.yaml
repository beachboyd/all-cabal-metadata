description: "# dimensional-codata\nCODATA recommended values of fundamental physical
  constants, \nfor use with the [dimensional](https://github.com/bjornbm/dimensional)
  library.\n\nThis module offers a selection of fundamental physical constants with
  their values as defined or measured\nand published by the Committee on Data for
  Science and Technology of the International Council for Science.\n\nThese values
  are from the 2014 CODATA recommended values, by way of NIST.\n\nThe original document
  offers many, many more constants than are provided here. An effort has been made
  to narrow it\ndown to the most useful ones. If your work requires others or if you
  have another contribution or suggestion, please\nsubmit issues or pull requests
  to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmcclean/dimensional-codata).\n"
