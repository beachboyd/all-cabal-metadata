description: ! 'An n-D distance transform that computes the Euclidean

  distance between each element in a discrete field and the nearest cell

  containing a zero.


  The algorithm implemented is based off of

  Meijster et al., /"A general algorithm for computing distance/

  /transforms in linear time."/ Parallel versions of both the Euclidean

  distance transform and squared Euclidean distance transform are also

  provided.'
