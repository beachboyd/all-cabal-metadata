  #### A Haskell library for probability distributions

  This library provides a data structure and associated functions for
  representing discrete probability distributions.

  This library is optimized for very fast sampling. If ```n``` is the number of unique outcomes,
  sampling from the distribution is ```O(log(n))``` worst case, and ```O(1)``` best case.

  The average time complexity depends on the distribution. A more evenly distributed
  distribution will be closer to ```O(log(n))```. A less evenly dsitributed distribution
  will be closer to ```O(1)```.
