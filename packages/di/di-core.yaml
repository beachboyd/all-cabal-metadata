  # di-core

  Typeful hierarchical structured logging without monad towers.

  If you like monad towers, though, check out
  [di-monad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-monad).

  Also, for a logging library, this one doesn't do any rendering of log messages.
  Please refer to [di-handle](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-handle)
  and [di-df1](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-df1) for that.
