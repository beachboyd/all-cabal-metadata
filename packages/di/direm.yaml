  * DiRem
    A simple utility to remove directories but retain their content
  ** Usage
     The command is called as =direm FILE= where =FILE= is the path to the directory you want to delete.
     It will then output what it will do:
     - copy all files from the directory to the parent directory
     - delete the directory

     The program asks for confirmation before doing that to prevent mistakes which can be rather time consuming to revert.
     If you are certain you got things right you can also call it as =direm FILE -y= to skip the confirmation.
     Note that this flag has to be *after* the parameter!
