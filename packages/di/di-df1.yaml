  # Version 1.2

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Renaming logging functions again.
    For example, `info` is the name we give to the `ToMessage`-polymorphic
    logging functions, `info_` to their `Message`-monomorphic version, and
    `info'` to the `STM` version. The previous `STM` suffix in `infoSTM`
    is gone, so as to mimick the naming conventions of `di-core`.

  * Export `attr_`.

  # Version 1.1

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: The `STM` compatible logging functions
    previously called `debug'`, `info'`, etc. are now called `debugSTM`,
    `infoSTM`, etc. The names such as `debug'`, `info'`, etc. are now what `debug`,
    `info`, etc. were in the previous version.

  * Take `ToValue` and `ToMessage` instances where possible, rather than values of
    type `Value` and `Message`.

  * `Di.Df1` now re-exports `Path`, `Segment`, `Key`, `Value`, `Message`,
    `ToKey(key)`, `ToValue(value)` and `ToMessage(message)`.


  # Version 1.0.2

  * Added `Df1`, `Df1T` and `MonadDf1` type-synonyms.


  # Version 1.0.1

  * Removed unnecessary `MonadIO` constraint.


  # Version 1.0

  * Consider this a preview release: The API is likely to stay stable, but
    extensive testing, formalization and tooling is due.

  # di-df1

  Write logs in the [df1](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/df1) using

  Consider this a preview release: The API is likely to stay stable, but extensive
  testing, formalization and tooling is due.
