description: ! 'This package is a native implementation of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

  It lives as a library, exporting an interface reminiscent of CGI or FastCGI.

  Thus policy on how namespace is mapped to files and/or scripts is entirely up

  to the client application.


  This package is partially compatible with direct-fastcgi by the same

  author, but is intended more by way of a replacement for it than a companion

  to it, and makes several design decisions differently.  The biggest is the

  use of MonadControlBase for exceptions.


  [Version 0.6] Substantial reworking of MVar handling, using safer primitives

  to be much more robust in the face of exceptions in pure code.


  [Version 0.5.3] Actually works with extension headers, by admitting the

  reality that they can occur anytime and not just with an entity.


  [Version 0.5.2] Actually works with daemonization, by using a feature of

  direct-daemon added for this purpose to open the socket after forking but

  before dropping privileges.


  [Version 0.5.1] Uses SafeSemaphore, which is the future, rather than QSem

  from base, which is deprecated.


  [Version 0.5.0.1] This preliminary release is a preview to gauge community

  interest.  Not even all major features are implemented; things that exist

  only as stubs include encryption, compression, chunking, and reading back

  cookies.  Nonetheless it may be useful if run behind a reverse proxy that

  provides the missing features transparently, such as Apache.'
