description: ! 'Diceware is a convenient way of generating secure and easy to remember
  passphrases. The idea is to throw a dice multiple times in order to draw a word
  from a list at random. The generated words are then concatenated, forming a passphrase.


  This program aims to generate a pretty LaTeX document for printing. The document
  is optimized for human usage, where in each page the first two throws (or only the
  first one, depending on the lenght of the list) are the same.'
