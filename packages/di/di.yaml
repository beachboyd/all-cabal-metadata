changelog: ! "# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: `mkDiTextStderr` and `mkDiStringHandle`
  return a `Di String\n  [String] String` now.\n\n* Made compatible with GHC 8.4.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: `Di` now takes a new type argument `level`.\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `Level` and all related functions in favour of a\n  new
  `level` argument to `Di` to be implemented by the user.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Require
  `Monoid` instance for the `path` type.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `level` function.
  Added `filter` function instead.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Drop `mkDiTextStderr` and
  `mkDiTextFileHandle` in favour of\n  `mkDiStringHandle` and `mkDiStringStderr`.
  The rationale is that we are\n  already paying the costs of many `show` calls, and
  users of this library are\n  quite likely to use `String`s anyway (since they, too,
  are likely using `show`\n  results). We will bring back `Text` based `mkDiTextStderr`
  when we can make it\n  performant.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Rename the `path` and `msg`
  functions to `contrapath` and\n  `contramsg`, flipping the order of their arguments
  so that the function comes\n  first (like in `contramap`).\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  The `push` function now takes the `Di` value as second\n  argument.\n\n* Fix ISO8601
  formatting of second fractions.\n\n* Export `flush`.\n\n* Stricter ordering of async
  messages.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Added a lot of documentation.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n*
  Initial version.\n\n"
