synopsis: Typeful hierarchical structured logging using di, mtl and df1.
changelog: ! "# Version 1.2\n\n* The `MonadThrow` instance for `DiT` doesn't log exceptions
  automatically any\n  more. This is because otherwise catching and re-throwing exceptions
  in\n  downstream code, by default, ends up logging the same exception more than\n
  \ once.\n\n* A `throw` function behaving as the previous `MonadThrow` instance was\n
  \ introduced.\n\n\n# Version 1.1.1\n\n* Documentation improvements.\n\n* Re-export
  `Df1.ToSegment`, `Df1.segment`, `Df1.ToMessage`, `Df1.message`,\n  `Df1.ToKey`,
  `Df1.key`, `Df1.ToValue`, `Df1.value`.\n\n# Version 1.1\n\n* **BREAKING CHANGE:**
  Exceptions are now logged _at the throw site_ by\n  default now when possible, with
  level `Warning`. See the changelog for\n  `di-monad-1.1`.\n\n\n# Version 1.0.1\n\n*
  COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: We don't export `Di`, `DiT` nor `MonadDi`\n  anymore.\n\n*
  Re-export `Df1.Path`, `Df1.Level`, `Di.Df1.Df1`, `Di.Df1.Monad.Df1T`,\n  `Di.Df1.Monad.MonadDf1`.\n\n\n\n#
  Version 1.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Most of what used to be in this library lives
  now in\n  `di-core`. This library is now intended to be an entry point to the various\n
  \ `di-*` libraries. Consider this first release of the new ecosystem a preview\n
  \ release: The API is likely to stay stable, but extensive testing,\n  formalization
  and tooling is due.\n\n# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: `mkDiTextStderr` and
  `mkDiStringHandle` return a `Di String\n  [String] String` now.\n\n* Made compatible
  with GHC 8.4.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: `Di` now takes a new type
  argument `level`.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `Level` and all related functions
  in favour of a\n  new `level` argument to `Di` to be implemented by the user.\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Require `Monoid` instance for the `path` type.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Removed `level` function. Added `filter` function instead.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Drop `mkDiTextStderr` and `mkDiTextFileHandle` in favour of\n  `mkDiStringHandle`
  and `mkDiStringStderr`. The rationale is that we are\n  already paying the costs
  of many `show` calls, and users of this library are\n  quite likely to use `String`s
  anyway (since they, too, are likely using `show`\n  results). We will bring back
  `Text` based `mkDiTextStderr` when we can make it\n  performant.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Rename the `path` and `msg` functions to `contrapath` and\n  `contramsg`, flipping
  the order of their arguments so that the function comes\n  first (like in `contramap`).\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: The `push` function now takes the `Di` value as second\n  argument.\n\n*
  Fix ISO8601 formatting of second fractions.\n\n* Export `flush`.\n\n* Stricter ordering
  of async messages.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Added a lot of documentation.\n\n\n# Version
  0.1\n\n* Initial version.\n\n"

  Typeful hierarchical structured logging using di, mtl and df1.


  This is meta-package bringing in together things from the `di-core`,

  `di-monad`, `di-handle` and `di-df1` libraries.
