description: ! 'This package is a wrapper around the daemon() function on BSD-like
  Unices,

  including Mac OS X and glibc-based Linux distributions.  It does not function

  on other systems.


  Version 3.1 adds the ability to do something after forking but before

  dropping privileges.  It also no longer uses the system-provided daemon()

  function, which is highly unfortunate but necessary with the RTS''s use of

  per-process timers.


  Version 3.0.0.1 updates this documentation to be properly broken into

  paragraphs.


  Version 3.0 cleans up the parameters structure.


  Version 2.0 fixes compatibility problems with the threaded GHC runtime.

  Doing this required two non-backwards-compatible API changes.  First, the

  daemonize function now takes an action to perform as a daemon, and never

  returns.  Second, the functionality of closing all open files has been

  removed, as it caused crashes.  As a substitute, the option of closing only

  the three standard streams has been added and made the default.


  Version 1.0 was the initial release.'
