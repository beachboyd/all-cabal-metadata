synopsis: mtl flavoured typeful hierarchical structured logging for di-core.
changelog: ! "# Version 1.1\n\n* **BREAKING CHANGE:** The `MonadThrow` instance for
  `DiT level path msg\n  m` instance now relies on `Di.Core.throw`, potentially logging\n
  \ exceptions _at the throw site_.  This introduces a new `MonadMask m`\n  instance
  constraint which can't be satisfied by `STM`. There is a\n  `DiT level path msg
  STM` instance that skips logging exceptions (which\n  is the only sensible behavior,
  anyway). However, if your `m` is not\n  exactly `STM` but some wrapper around it,
  you will need to provide a\n  `MonadThrow` instance manually or use `Di.Core.throw'`
  directly. On\n  the other hand, satisfying this `MonadMask` constraint should be
  easy\n  for monads that can run `IO`.\n\n* Added `onException`.\n\n# Version 1.0.2\n\n*
  Backwards compatibility with `mtl < 2.2.2`.\n\n# Version 1.0.1\n\n* Backwards compatibility
  with `transformers < 0.5.3`.\n\n# Version 1.0\n\n* This is a new library part of
  the `di-core` ecosystem.\n  Consider this first release of the new ecosystem a preview
  release: The API is\n  likely to stay stable, but extensive testing, formalization
  and tooling is\n  due.\n\n"
