  0.0.3 [2019.05.02]
  ------------------
  * Fix the build on Windows.
  * Remove the `doctests` test suite, as there were never any `doctest`s to
    begin with.

  0.0.2
  -----
  * Add a library dependency on the `doctests` test suite

  0.0.1
  -----
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/gc.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/gc)

  Experimenting with building [Poor Richard's Memory Manager](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~mhertz/prmm-ismm-2011.pdf) in Haskell user space.

  Usage:

  ```haskell
  import System.Mem.Manager

  main = do
    _ <- selfishManager
    ...
  ```

  Now an oracle will look for signs of memory pressure from the host operating system and attempt more aggressive garbage collection
  in response.
