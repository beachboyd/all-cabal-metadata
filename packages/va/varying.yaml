changelog: "change log\n==========\n\n0.1.5.0 - added Control.Varying.Spline\n\n0.2.0.0
  - reordered spline type variables for MonadTrans\n\n0.3.0.0 - updated the type of
  mapOutput to a more friendly, usable signature\n          bug fixes\n\n0.3.1.0 -
  added stepMany, eitherE\n\n0.4.0.0 - Var and Spline are now parameterized with Identity,
  removed mix, changed\n          the behavior of race, added untilEvent variants,
  added tests\n\n0.5.0.0 - changed stepMany to remove Monoid requirement, added raceMany,
  added\n          anyE, more tests and SplineT obeys Applicative and Monad laws\n\n0.5.0.1
  - removed time as dependency\n\n0.5.0.2 - separated tweening time and value, added
  runSplineE, builds on all GHC\n          since 7.6\n\n0.6.0.0 - changed the internal
  type of SplineT to use Either, reducing unused\n          output values and preventing
  time/space leaks. Updated tween types.\n          Added withTween(_).\n\n0.7.0.0
  - added proofs, reduced API size by removing trivial or weird (special)\n          combinators,
  changed some names, Event is a synonym of Maybe, removed\n\t  Time (moved functions
  to Event), renamed Event.mergeE to Event.bothE,\n          added Spline.untilProc
  and Spline.whileProc, documentation - working \n\t  towards 1.0\n"

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/varying.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/varying)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schell/varying.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/schell/varying)

  This library provides automaton based value streams and sequencing useful for
  functional reactive programming (FRP) and locally stateful programming (LSP).

  ## Getting started

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Control.Varying
  import Control.Applicative
  import Control.Concurrent (forkIO, killThread)
  import Data.Functor.Identity
  import Data.Time.Clock

  -- | A simple 2d point type.
  data Point = Point { px :: Float
                     , py :: Float
                     } deriving (Show, Eq)

  newtype Delta = Delta { unDelta :: Float }

  -- An exponential tween back and forth from 0 to 50 over 1 seconds that
  -- loops forever. This spline takes float values of delta time as input,
  -- outputs the current x value at every step.
  tweenx :: Monad m => TweenT Float Float m Float
  tweenx = do
      -- Tween from 0 to 50 over 1 second
      tween_ easeOutExpo 0 50 1
      -- Chain another tween back to the starting position
      tween_ easeOutExpo 50 0 1
      -- Loop forever
      tweenx

  -- An exponential tween back and forth from 0 to 50 over 1 seconds that never
  -- ends.
  tweeny :: Monad m => TweenT Float Float m Float
  tweeny = do
      tween_ easeOutExpo 50 0 1
      tween_ easeOutExpo 0 50 1
      tweeny

  -- Our time signal counts input delta time samples.
  time :: Monad m => VarT m Delta Float
  time = var unDelta

  -- | Our Point value that varies over time continuously in x and y.
  backAndForth :: Monad m => VarT m Delta Point
  backAndForth =
      -- Turn our splines into continuous output streams. We must provide
      -- a starting value since splines are not guaranteed to be defined at
      -- their edges.
      let x = tweenStream tweenx 0
          y = tweenStream tweeny 0
      in
      -- Construct a varying Point that takes time as an input.
      (Point <$> x <*> y)
          -- Stream in a time signal using the 'plug left' combinator.
          -- We could similarly use the 'plug right' (~>) function
          -- and put the time signal before the construction above. This is needed
          -- because the tween streams take time as an input.
          <~ time

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      putStrLn "An example of value streams using the varying library."
      putStrLn "Enter a newline to continue, and then a newline to quit"
      _ <- getLine

      t   <- getCurrentTime
      tId <- forkIO $ loop backAndForth t

      _ <- getLine
      killThread tId

  loop :: Var Delta Point -> UTCTime -> IO ()
  loop v t = do
    t1 <- getCurrentTime
    -- Here we'll run in the Identity monad using a time delta provided by
    -- getCurrentTime and diffUTCTime.
    let dt = realToFrac $ diffUTCTime t1 t
        Identity (Point x y, vNext) = runVarT v $ Delta dt
        xStr = replicate (round x) ' ' ++ "x" ++ replicate (50 - round x) ' '
        yStr = replicate (round y) ' ' ++ "y" ++ replicate (50 - round y) ' '
        str  = zipWith f xStr yStr
        f 'x' 'y' = '|'
        f 'y' 'x' = '|'
        f a ' ' = a
        f ' ' b = b
        f _ _ = ' '
    putStrLn str
    loop vNext t1
  ```

  # Publications

  The concept of `VarT` that this library is built on is isomorphic to Monadic Stream Functions as defined in "[Functional Reactive Programming, Refactored](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2976010)" ([mirror](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxip1/#FRPRefactored)).

  The isomorphism is
  ``` haskell
  toMSF :: Functor m => VarT m a b -> MSF m a b
  toMSF = MSF . (fmap . fmap . fmap $ toMSF) . runVarT

  toVarT :: Functor m => MSF m a b -> VarT m a b
  toVarT = VarT . (fmap . fmap . fmap $ toVarT) . unMSF
  ```
