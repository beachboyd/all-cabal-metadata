synopsis: A data-type like Either but with an accumulating Applicative
changelog: ! '0.6.0


  * Delete `Validation`, `ValidationB`, `ValidationT`, `Validation''`

  * Remove `_Validation` member from `Validate` class


  0.5.5


  * Raise upper bounds on base.

  * Include nix build.


  0.5.4


  * remove redundant constraints.

  * add instance `Validate` for `ValidationB Identity`.


  0.5.3


  * Update `transformers` dependency to work with GHC8.


  0.5.2


  * Remove LANGUAGE Safe because won''t build against lens-4.13 or higher otherwise.


  0.5.1


  * Update documentation


  0.5.0


  * Export the `ValidationB` (formerly `ValidationTB`) data type.

  * Renamed `ValidationTB` to `ValidationB`.

  * Add upper-bounds on some dependencies.

  * Move repository to https://github.com/NICTA/validation.

  * Add README.

  * Update copyright notice for 2015.


  0.4.3


  * Rename `ValidationT` to `ValidationTB`

  * Introduce `ValidationT` with `MonadTrans` instance


  0.4.2


  * Export constructors on `AccValidation` and `Validation`.


  0.4.1


  * Remove `Alternative` instances. They are obscene.

  * INLINE pragmas


  0.4.0


  * Change the premise of the `Validate` type-class to more strongly reflect the isomorphism
  to Either.

  * The `_Failure` and `_Success` prisms are now derived.

  * Lots more examples


  0.3.0


  A restructuring of 0.2.x where:


  * Tests updated to use doctest

  * Update API to use Prism and Iso (Control.Lens)

  * Rename package Validation (deprecated) to validation


  0.3.1


  Use Safe Haskell pragma


  0.3.2


  Implement Validate on Either


  0.3.3


  Provide Isos between (ValidationT Identity) and other data types.


  0.3.4


  Loosen the type of the Isos for polymorphic update.

  A data-type like Either but with differing properties and type-class

  instances.


  Library support is provided for this different representation, include

  `lens`-related functions for converting between each and abstracting over their

  similarities.


  * `AccValidation`


  The `AccValidation` data type is isomorphic to `Either`, but has an instance

  of `Applicative` that accumulates on the error side. That is to say, if two

  (or more) errors are encountered, they are appended using a `Semigroup`

  operation.


  As a consequence of this `Applicative` instance, there is no corresponding

  `Bind` or `Monad` instance. `AccValidation` is an example of, "An applicative

  functor that is not a monad."'
