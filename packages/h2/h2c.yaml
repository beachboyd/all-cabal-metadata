description: ! "# h2c: Haskell bindings to Linux I2C API\n\nH2C is a binding to the
  Linux i2c-tools/i2c-dev API.\nIt uses the I2C_RDWR ioctl for repeated-start communications
  between master and slave.\n\n## Notes\n - You'll probably have to run as root. Getting
  regular users direct access to i2c busses on Linux is tricky.\n - The Linux i2c-stub
  driver that you might think would be useful for testing doesn't support the I2C_RDWR
  ioctl.\n   This is why, if you try to use it, you'll get the \"invalid argument\"
  error.\n\n## Documentation\n` $ stack haddock --open`, find module `System.IO.I2C`\n\nBE
  CAREFUL WITH I2C. It can be used to poke at things like your graphics card, fans,
  &c.\n\nSee my library [bno055-haskell](https://bitbucket.org/fmapE/bno055-haskell)
  for examples of h2c in use.\n\n"
