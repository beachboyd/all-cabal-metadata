  # Changelog

  ## 1.2.0 (2020-03-19)

  #### Changed

  - `OrgStyle` has been given an extra field, `separator` for defining what should
    appear between adjacent elements (e.g. spaces between words).
  - `defaultStyle` has been updated to reflect the above.

  ## 1.1.1 (2020-03-13)

  #### Fixed

  - Support for `org-mode-1.1`.

  ## 1.1.0 (2020-03-07)

  #### Changed

  - `OrgStyle` given a new field `highlighting` which allows one to inject
    customized rendering behaviour for Org source blocks. Combined with
    `skylighting-lucid`, this can be used for server-side syntax highlighting.
  - Inlined `<code>` tags resulting from org highlighting with `~~` now also have
    an `org-highlighting` class.

  ## 1.0.1 (2020-03-06)

  #### Fixed

  - A minor rendering bug involving parentheses in lists, tables, and headings.

  ## 1.0.0 (2020-03-05)

  #### Added

  - Initial version of all `Html` conversion functions.

  # ord-mode-lucid

  This is a child library of `org-mode` that allows its types to be converted into
  `Html` structures from the `lucid` library. This allows one to easily parse and
  embed Org content directly into a Lucid-based website.
