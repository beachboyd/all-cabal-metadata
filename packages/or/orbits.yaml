  *For my uncle Zbys who watched the planets and stars.*

  -----

  Types and functions for dealing with Kepler orbits.

  The main data type is `Orbit`, which describes the path of a body in orbit.

  Nomenclature
  ------------

  | Symbol | Meaning                          | Notes                          |
  |--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
  | a      | Semi-major axis                  | Negative for hyperbolic orbits |
  | b      | Semi-minor axis                  | Negative for hyperbolic orbits |
  | e      | Eccentricity                     |                                |
  | q      | Periapsis                        |                                |
  | i      | Inclination                      |                                |
  | μ      | Standard gravitational parameter |                                |
  | Ω      | Longitude of the ascending node  |                                |
  | l      | Semi-latus Rectum                |                                |
  | n      | Mean motion                      |                                |
  | p      | Period                           |                                |
  | t      | Time since periapse              |                                |
  | M      | Mean anomaly                     |                                |
  | E      | Eccentric anomaly                | Only for elliptic orbits       |
  | ν      | True anomaly                     |                                |


  Note that in the Haskell source uppercase symbols such as Ω and M are written
  with a leading underscore.

  Implementation
  --------------

  This package makes use of the
  [`units`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units) package to ensure that the
  implementation is correct regarding units of measure.
