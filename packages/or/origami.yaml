description: ! 'The Origami package consists of a coding pattern for transforming

  heterogenously typed data and Template Haskell macros to support

  the pattern.  It operates in the same problem space as SYB, but

  generates the boilerplate for the user.


  In the pattern, we focus on a specific set of types, the /fold/

  /family/.  For each constructor of each of those types, the user

  will define a function to "replace" the constructor when folding.


  These functions are collected together into a single record.  (Its

  declaration is generated for the user.)  Collecting the functions

  together forces the typing of all the functions to remain

  consistent and facilitates code reuse.


  For each datatype, a fold function is automatically generated that

  applies the fold record to values of that datatype.  It decomposes

  the value into parts according to its constructor, recursively

  applies the fold to the parts, then puts them back together using

  the replacement constructor function from the record.


  As with SYB, Origami lets the user think on a higher-level of

  abstraction about data transformation and relieves her from the

  need to write boilerplate.
