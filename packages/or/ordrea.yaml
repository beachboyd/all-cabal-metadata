description: ! 'This is an FRP library with the following characteristics:


  * classical: it has first-class signals


  * synchronous: it has a clear notion of simultaneous events


  * higher-order: signals inside signals can be flattened

  to get a switching behavior


  * push-based: inactive events has zero runtime costs


  This package is in the alpha stage.'
