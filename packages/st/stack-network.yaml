description: ! "# stack-network\n\n## About\nThis is a program I built as part of
  my Final Year Project in College. The project is titled __An Exploration into the
  Distribution of Stack__ in which I designed and tested a few approaches for distributing
  Stack. stack-network uses [Cloud Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cloud-haskell)
  and [pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) to efficiently transmit files
  between nodes on a network and thus minimise build times.\n\n## Testing\n \n__Prerequisites__\n\n[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)\n\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  (installed and running)\n\n`docker pull mcgizzle/stack-network`\n\n`stack test`\n\nThis
  will run a number of scenarios created from `docker-compose` files embedded into
  the program using [Quasi-Quotes](https://wiki.haskell.org/Quasiquotation).\n\n##
  Building & Running\n \n`stack build`\n\nEnsure you have a `network.config` file\n\n```\nnet
  \n{\n\thost = \"127.0.0.1\"\n\tport = \"5000\"\n}\n```\n\nUpdate the port and host
  as appropriate.\n\n`stack exec stack-network --help` will list the options\n\nTo
  see the program in action it is suggested running it with Docker. I have provided
  an image that wil work with the tests and the docker-compose located in the project
  root.\n\nPull the image from Docker\n\n`docker pull mcgizzle/stack-network`\n\nRun
  this from the root of the project\n\n`docker-compose up`\n\n\n\n"
