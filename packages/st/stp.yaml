description: ! '# Simple Theorem Prover


  Simple Theorem Prover is a proof tree generator. It allows for specifying axioms
  and inference rules, and then by quering the program it will produce all valid combinations
  of inference in attempt to reach a target result.


  This project is based on [Simple theorem prover in Racket](https://bor0.wordpress.com/2018/08/07/simple-theorem-prover-in-racket/).
