  ============


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-setup.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-setup)


  An executable for easily setting up a Haskell work environment. This project is
  similar in spirit to minGHC. It is currently Linux (64 bit) only, but with hopes
  of making it cross platform eventually.


  Currently includes: ghc, cabal, happy, alex, and various

  stackage-cli plugins.


  ```

  $ stackage-setup ghc-7.8

  ```


  ```

  $ stackage-setup ghc-7.10

  ```
