description: ! 'This package provides head normal form strict versions of some

  standard Haskell concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which

  provide control over where evaluation takes place not offered by

  the default lazy types. This may be useful for deciding when and

  where evaluation occurs, leading to improved time or space use,

  depending on the circumstances.'
