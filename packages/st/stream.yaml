  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stream)


  *NOTE* This library is very much in prerelease state. If you see this released

  anywhere, it''s just available for easier sharing with others. Please do _not_

  start using it yet.


  Streaming data library built around making stream fusion a first-class concept.

  Focus is on high performance and usability.


  Unlike more commonly used streaming libraries (like conduit, enumerator, or

  pipes), this library is _not_ coroutine based.
