changelog: "__0.5.0__\n  Changes:\n        - new conduit version (> 1.0)\n\n__0.3.1__\n
  \ Changes:\n\n\t- stompl version >= 0.5.0 is now mandatory\n          Rational:
  previous versions were very slow\n                    on parsing large messages.\n
  \                   Version 0.5.0 solve this problem.\n                    Benchmarks
  show that messages of 1MB and\n                    beyond are parsed up to 10.000
  times faster.\n\n__0.2.2__\n \n   Changes (minor):\n \n         - add these lines
  to the changelog...\n         \n__0.2.1__ \n\n   Changes:\n\n         - New option
  to add a handler for error messages\n\n         - New option to add a wait interval
  to wait for the error handler\n\n__0.2.0__ \n   Changes:\n\n          - Low-level
  sockets were replaced by network-conduit-tls\n            (Be aware that this change
  might introduce some\n             subtle changes in behaviour concerning in particular
  \n             performance and connection handling)\n\n          - OMaxRecv not
  used anymore\n\n          - New Option OTLS for TLS connections\n\n          - New
  Option OTmo to specify a connection timeout\n\n__0.1.4__ \n   Changes:\n\n          -
  New: destroyReader and destroyWriter\n\n          - Patterns deprecated\n\n__0.1.3__
  \n   New Option for newWriter 'ONoContentLen'\n\n\n__0.1.2__ \n   Minor changes:\n\n
  \         - Dependency for stompl-0.1.1\n\n          - Some more enquiries into
  potential mem leaks,\n            but more to follow\n\n__0.1.1__ \n   Dependency
  for bytestring 0.10\n\n__0.1.0__ \n   Major changes:\n\n          - Compliance with
  Stomp 1.2:\n\n          - There are major changes in the frame format,\n            please
  refer to the documentation of the \n            stompl package, version 0.1.0, there
  are important changes\n            that may impact messages for older versions!\n\n
  \         - When generating an Ack frame,\n            the *id* header is by default
  taken from the *ack* header\n            in the corresponding Message frame.\n            Should
  there be no *ack* header or if its value is empty,\n            the value of the
  header *message-id* is taken.\n            This behaviour complies with 1.2 \n            for
  brokers supporting this version,\n            but also continues to work with 1.1
  brokers.\n\n          - It is now possible to send a Stomp frame\n            to
  connect to a broker (the broker, of course,\n            has to accept Stomp frames
  and process them correctly).\n            There is a new Copt (*OStomp*) to support
  this feature.\n\n__0.0.8__ \n   Client/Server on top of Queues.\n\n__0.0.7__ \n
  \  Fighting with hackagedb...\n\n__0.0.6__ \n      Heartbeats caused a memory leak
  by creating \n      many Connection instances in the connection state list.\n      The
  connections were lazily deleted, i.e. were\n      not deleted at all.\n      Connection
  state is now cleaned up by a strict delete.\n\n__0.0.5__ \n   Major changes:\n\n
  \         - Underscore functions (*withConnection_*) removed; \n\n          - New
  *with* functions: *withWriter*, *withPair*;\n\n          - New option for connection
  (ClientId);\n\n          - Headers for broker-specific options can be passed to
  connection\n            (this changes the *withConnection* type signature!)\n\n__0.0.3__
  \n   New interface writeAdHoc\n\n__0.0.2__ \n   Minor corrections\n\n__0.0.1__ \n
  \  Initial release\n"

  The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.
  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)
  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues.
  Interoperating applications do not know
  the location or internal structure of each other.
  They see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages
  published and subscribed through the broker.

  The Stomp Queue library provides
  a Stomp client, using abstractions like
  'Connection', 'Transaction', 'Queue' and 'Message'.
  The library may use TLS for secure connections
  to brokers that provide security over TLS.

  More information, examples and a test suite are available
  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.
