  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-types.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-types)

  This is a repository for sharing data types across multiple packages in the
  [Stackage project](https://www.stackage.org). In particular, it started as a
  means of sharing code between
  [stackage-curator](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-curator) and
  [stackage-server](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-server).

  For more information on the overall Stackage project, please see [the main
  stackage repo](https://github.com/fpco/stackage).
