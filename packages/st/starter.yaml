  # What is starter?

  Server side software development usually needs frequent restarts. You would launch
  a server, make

  code changes, recompile the code, and then restart the server. Starter attempts
  to automate this

  tedious cycle.


  See documentation of module `Starter` for details.


  An example web server using starter can be found in `example` directory.
