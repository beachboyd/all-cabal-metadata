  [![Hackage version badge](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/string-like.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-like)

  This package is based on the [**`Text.StringLike`** module](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tagsoup/docs/Text-StringLike.html) of the [**`tagsoup`** package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tagsoup).

  The package defines a typeclass that can be implemented to provide a uniform interface for `String`-like objects.

  The typeclass itself has default implementations that convert the `StringLike`
  item first to a lazy `Text`, then performs the operation, and converts results back to
  its `StringLike` object. This is usually /not/ as efficient as an operation for
  that specific type. Therefore it is advisable to implement the other functions as well.

  One can however decide to only implement `fromText` and `toText`; or `toString`.
