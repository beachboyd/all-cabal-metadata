description: |-
  The Stomp Protocol specifies a reduced message broker
  with queues usually read by one application and written
  by one or more applications.
  The specification does not include other, more advanced,
  interoperability patterns, where, for example,
  a client requests a job from a server or
  a publisher sends data to many subscribers.
  Such communication patterns, apparantly,
  are left to be implemented by applications.
  Patterns like client-server, publish and subscribe
  and many others, however, are used over and over again
  in message-oriented applications.

  This library implements a number of communication patterns
  on top of the Stomp specification
  that are often used and often described in the literature.
  There is a set of /basic/ patterns,

  * client-server,

  * publish and subscribe and

  * pusher-worker (pipeline)

  as well as a set of derived patterns, namely:

  * Desk: A service to obtain the access point
  (/i.e./ queue name) of a specified provider;

  * Load balancers: Services to balance requests
  among a group of connected /workers/
  (a.k.a. /Majordomo/ pattern);

  * Bridge: Connections between brokers.

  More information, examples and a test suite are available
  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.
  The Stomp specification can be found at
  <http://stomp.github.com>.

  The notion of /pattern/ and the related concepts,
  as they are presented here,
  rely heavily on
  Pieter Hintjens, \"Code Connected\", O'Reilly, 2013
  (see also <http://hintjens.com/books>).
