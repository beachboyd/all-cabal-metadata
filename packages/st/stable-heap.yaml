description: ! 'This library provides a purely functional implementation of

  stable heaps (fair priority queues). The data structure is a

  cousin of the pairing heap which maintains a sequential

  ordering of the keys. Insertion can be to either end of the

  heap, as though it is a deque, and it can be split on the

  left-most occurrence of the minimum key.


  The current state of the package is fairly barebones. It will

  be fleshed out later.'
