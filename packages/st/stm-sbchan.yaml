description: ! 'This library provides a bounded first-in first-out channel type for
  use in

  STM.  It supports a limit on the /total size/ of items in the channel.


  stm-sbchan also provides a few features not found in other bounded channel

  libraries, such as:


  * Alternative overflow strategies @cramSBChan@ and @rollSBChan@.

  @cramSBChan@ ignores the channel''s size limit, and @rollSBChan@

  removes old items from the beginning of the channel when it fills up.


  * The channel limit can be adjusted at runtime.'
