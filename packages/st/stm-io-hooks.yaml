description: ! 'This library provides a Software Transactional Memory (STM) monad
  with commit and retry IO hooks.

  A retry-action is run (at least once) if the transaction retries, while commit-actions
  are

  executed iff the transaction commits. The AdvSTM monad also gives some atomicity

  guarantees for commit-actions:


  * When a TVar is modified in a transaction and this transaction commits,

  the update remains invisible to other threads until the corresponding

  onCommit action is run.


  * If the onCommit action throws an exception, the original values of

  the modified TVars are restored.


  Note: The package can be used as a drop-in replacement for

  ''Control.Concurrent.STM''.


  Feedback is welcome!'
