  # stack-clean-old

  A small tool to clean away older Haskell [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org)
  snapshot builds and ghc versions, to recover diskspace.

  ## Usage
  ```
  stack-clean-old [project|snapshots|ghc] [size|list|remove-version] [GHCVER]
  ```
  These commands act respectively on:

  - the current local project (`.stack-work/install/`)
  - the user's stack snapshot builds (`~/.stack/snapshots/`)
  - installed stack ghc compilers  (`~/.stack/programs/`).

  `size`:
      prints the total size of the above directory
      (`size` does not take a GHCVER argument).

  `list`:
      shows the total size and number of snapshots per ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is optional).

  `remove-version`:
      removes all snapshots for the specified ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is required).

  NB: If you remove all snapshot builds for a version of ghc, then you would have to rebuild again for any projects still using them, so removal should be used cautiously, but it can recover a lot of diskspace.

  ### Purging older stack project builds
  ```
  stack-clean-old project remove-older
  ```
  This command removes older stack builds from `.stack-work/install/`.
  By default it keeps 5 newest builds per ghc version.

  The preservation/deletion is calculated and done per ghc version.

  NB: If you regularly build multiple branches/tags against the same LTS or ghc version then it is probably safer to avoid using `remove-older`.

  ## Installation

  Run `stack install` or `cabal install`
