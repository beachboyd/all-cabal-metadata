  # stack-clean-old

  A small tool to clean away older Haskell [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org)
  snapshot builds and ghc versions, to recover diskspace.

  ## Usage
  ```
  stack-clean-old [project|snapshots|ghc] [size|list|remove-version|remove-earlier-minor] [GHCVER]
  ```
  These commands act respectively on:

  - the current local **project**: `.stack-work/install/`
  - the user's stack **snapshot** builds: `~/.stack/snapshots/`
  - installed stack **ghc** compilers: `~/.stack/programs/`.

  and the subcommands:

  `size`:
      prints the total size of the above directory
      (`size` does not take a GHCVER argument).

  `list`:
      shows the total size and number of snapshots per ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is optional).

  `remove-version`:
      removes all snapshots for the specified ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is required).

  `remove-earlier-minor`:
      removes the builds/installs for previous minor ghc versions.
      If GHCVER is given then only minor versions older than it are removed.

  NB: If you remove all snapshot builds for a version of ghc, then you would have to rebuild again for any projects still using them, so removal should be used cautiously, but it can recover a lot of diskspace.

  NBB: All the command support `--dryrun` (`-n`) so you can check the effect
  of running them safely beforehand.

  ### Example usage
  To remove project builds for ghc-8.2.2:
  ```
  $ stack-clean-old project list
  154M  8.2.2  (5 dirs)
  154M  8.4.4  (5 dirs)
  163M  8.6.5  (5 dirs)
  $ stack-clean-old project remove-version 8.2.2
  ```

  Remove all stack ghc-8.4 snapshot builds before 8.4.4:
  ```
  $ stack-clean-old snapshots list 8.4
  421M  8.4.1  (7 dirs)
  368M  8.4.2  (6 dirs)
  489M  8.4.3  (8 dirs)
  799M  8.4.4  (24 dirs)
  $ stack-clean-old snapshots remove-earlier-minor 8.4.4
  7 dirs removed for 8.4.1
  6 dirs removed for 8.4.2
  8 dirs removed for 8.4.3
  ```

  Incidently I build my projects across as many major Stackage LTS versions as possible, and collectively this piles up to a lot of diskspace: so I wrote this tool to help manage that.

  ### Purging older stack project builds
  ```
  stack-clean-old project remove-older
  ```
  This command removes older stack builds from `.stack-work/install/`.
  By default it keeps 5 newest builds per ghc version.

  The preservation/deletion is calculated and done per ghc version.

  NB: If you regularly build your project for several branches/tags against the same LTS or ghc version then it is safer to avoid using `remove-older`.

  Also `stack-clean-old project remove-work` can be used to recursively remove
  all `.stack-work/` dirs from a project to save space.

  ## Installation

  Run `stack install` or `cabal install`
