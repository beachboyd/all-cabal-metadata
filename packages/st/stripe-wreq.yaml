  This package helps you make requests to the
  <https://stripe.com/ Stripe> API in conjunction with
  the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq wreq> package.
  This is a minimal library that makes no attempt obscure
  either its underpinnings in Wreq or any of the details of the
  Stripe API. Responses are returned as
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson aeson> values.
