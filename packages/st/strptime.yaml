description: ! 'This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows to parse

  dates and times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library

  creates LocalTime values. It provides some extra features which

  the original strptime lacks - parsing of fractional seconds and parsing

  of ten-powers of seconds since epoch (for example milliseconds since epoch).'
