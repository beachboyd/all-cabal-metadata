  # stripe-hs

  Unofficial and incomplete Stripe SDK/client for Haskell. It's generated via `servant-client` from `stripe-servant` with a small amount of hand-written code. Contributions are welcome!

  ## Install

  ``` sh
  # stack
  stack install stripe-hs

  # cabal
  cabal install stripe-hs
  ```

  ## Example

  ``` haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  import Stripe.Client

  import System.Environment (getEnv)
  import Network.HTTP.Client
  import Network.HTTP.Client.TLS

  main :: IO ()
  main =
    do manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings
       apiKey <- T.pack <$> getEnv "STRIPE_KEY"
       let client = makeStripeClient apiKey manager
       result <-
           createCustomer cli (CustomerCreate Nothing (Just "mail@athiemann.net"))
       print result
  ```

  ## Features

  The package provides a module for webhook signature verification (see `Stripe.Webhook.Verify`).

  Supported APIs/Resources:
  * Customers
  * Products
  * Prices
  * CustomerPortal
  * CheckoutSession
  * Events

  *Note that all resources are likely missing fields. The library is currently focused on to be used in combination with Stripe's hosted surfaces (Customer Portal and Checkout).*

  ## Running the tests

  You can run all tests with `stack test`. You'll need a Stripe testmode API Key assigned to the `STRIPE_KEY` environment variable and you'll need to setup a Customer Portal configuration in the Stripe dashboard before running them.
