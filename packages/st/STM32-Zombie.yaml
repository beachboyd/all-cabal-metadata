description: ! 'This library turns a STM32F103 board into a powerful Haskell hackable

  IO adapter. Features are GPIO pins, serial ports, SPI ports, DMA

  ADC, timers,..

  The library is modeled after the STMicroelectronics

  STM32F10x Firmware Library.

  The library has a rather low-level interface, which

  allows one to control many details of the micro controller hardware

  and can also be used to build higher level abstraction.

  See the "App.Blink" module

  and the [github page](https://github.com/MarcFontaine/stm32hs)'
