description: ! 'The STM32-Zombie library turns a STM32F103 board into a

  powerful Haskell hackable IO adapter.

  Features are GPIO pins, serial ports, SPI ports, DMA ADC, timers,..

  The library is modeled after the STMicroelectronics

  STM32F10x Firmware Library but does not rely on any c-code or

  cross-compilation

  STM32-Zombie has a low-level interface, which

  allows one to control many details of the micro controller hardware

  and can also be used to build higher level abstraction.

  See the "App.Blink" module

  and the [github page](https://github.com/MarcFontaine/stm32hs)'
