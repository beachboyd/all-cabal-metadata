changelog: ! "3.0.0.4 (2015-05-30):\n    - Moved VERSION to CHANGELOG\n3.0.0.3 (2015-03-29):\n
  \   - Cleaning up headers to compile cleanly with GHC 7.10\n3.0.0 (2013-05-29):\n
  \   - Removed the deprecated compatibility modules.\n\n2.1.0 (2013-05-29):\n    -
  Added UNPACK pragmas everywhere to reduce indirections.\n    - Added versions of
  newBroadcastT*Chan for TMChan\n    - Deprecated all the compatibility stuff, since
  newBroadcastTChan requires stm >= 2.4 anyways.\n2.0.0 (2013-05-12):\n    - Add TQueue
  support\n\n1.3.1 (2012-02-29):\n    - Corrected the CPP macros now that stm-2.3
  is released.\n1.3.0 (2012-02-25):\n    - Added Control.Concurrent.STM.TMVar.Compat\n1.2.0.3
  (2012-02-12):\n    - Change stability from experimental to provisional.\n1.2.0.2
  (2012-02-12):\n    - Documentation fix for Control.Concurrent.STM.TMChan.writeTMChan\n1.2.0.1
  (2011-05-07):\n    - Moved old TBChan,TBMChan implementations to ./test/bench/\n1.2.0
  (2011-05-07):\n    - Various optimizations.\n    - Switched to using 2 TVars in
  TBChan and TBMChan, reducing\n      contention between readers and writers and improving
  throughput\n      considerably (when multiple OS threads are used).\n    - Control.Concurrent.STM.TBChan:
  added estimateFreeSlotsTBChan,\n      freeSlotsTBChan\n    - Control.Concurrent.STM.TBMChan:
  added estimateFreeSlotsTBMChan,\n      freeSlotsTBMChan\n1.1.0 (2011-04-05):\n    -
  Control.Concurrent.STM.TBChan: added tryWriteTBChan\n    - Control.Concurrent.STM.TBMChan:
  added tryWriteTBMChan\n1.0.0 (2011-04-03):\n    - Initial version forked from Posta-IPC.\n
  \   - Added tryRead* and tryPeek* functions for the various channels.\n"

description: ! "stm-chans\n=========\n\nIn general, this is a simple package and should
  be easy to install.\nIt does require GHC however, because it relies on the\nControl.Concurrent.STM.TChan
  type which (for some unknown reason)\nis GHC-only. With the cabal-install program
  you can just do:\n\n    $> cabal install stm-chans\n\nOr if you don't have cabal-install,
  then you can use the Cabal\nlibrary:\n\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure\n    $>
  runhaskell Setup.hs build\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  haddock --hyperlink-source\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  register\n\nThe test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock\nstep
  is also optional.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
  fin.\n"
