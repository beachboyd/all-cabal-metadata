description: ! 'This package provides several functions to quickly

  search for substrings in strict or lazy ByteStrings.

  It also provides functions for breaking or splitting

  on substrings and replacing all occurrences of a

  substring (the first in case of overlaps) with another.

  GHC before 6.10 are no longer supported, other compilers

  only if they support BangPatterns. If you need it to

  work with other compilers, send a feature request.'
