  A monad transformer version of the ST monad
  Warning! This monad transformer should not be used with monads that
  can contain multiple answers, like the list monad. The reason is that
  the state token will be duplicated across the different answers and
  this causes Bad Things to happen (such as loss of referential
  transparency). Safe monads include the monads State, Reader, Writer,
  Maybe and combinations of their corresponding monad transformers.
