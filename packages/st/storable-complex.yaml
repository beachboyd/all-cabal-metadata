description: ! '# what is storable-complex?


  historically, `Complex a` didn''t have a storable instance in base,

  and thus storable-complex was born!


  # when might i use this package?


  you''re using an older ghc/version of base AND calling out to some C or fortran

  codes around complex numbers. You might find yourself needing this then!


  # when might i regret using this?

  if you''re writing your own orphan instances instead of using base-orphans,

  you might have a bad day, use base-orphans (and storable-complex) instead!
