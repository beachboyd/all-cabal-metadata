  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-install.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-install)


  `stackage-install` provides a wrapper around the `cabal install` command, which

  will download packages more securely. Initially, this means downloading over an

  HTTPS connection from FP Complete''s Amazon S3 mirror of Hackage, though more

  hardening is planned for the future (see future improvements below).


  To install, simply run `cabal update && cabal install stackage-install`. Usage

  is intended to overlap well with `cabal install`. Whenever you would have run

  `cabal install foo`, you can now run `stackage-install foo` (or `stk install

  foo` with [stackage-cli](http://github.com/fpco/stackage-cli) installed), which

  will perform the following steps:


  1. Run `cabal install --dry-run ...` to get cabal''s build plan

  2. Download the relevant packages from S3, and place them in the locations that
  `cabal-install` expects

  3. Run `cabal install ...`


  ## Security


  In addition to using HTTPS for download, `stackage-install` can use features of

  the [all-cabal-hashes](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-hashes)

  repository for extra guarantees. In particular, if you have appropriate data in

  your package index (see next paragraph), `stackage-install` will automatically

  verify both the hash of the package contents and the download size. If the

  server attempts to send more data than expected, the download will be

  terminated.


  The easiest way to get this extra data into your package index is to use

  [stackage-update](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-update) with the `--hashes`

  option. See [hash

  downloads](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-update#hash-downloads) for more

  information.


  ## Caveats


  If you have a modified `remote-repo` in your ~/.cabal/config file, this tool

  will not provide proper hardening. Most users do not modify their remote-repo,

  so this shouldn''t be an issue most of the time.


  There are some combinations of `cabal install` arguments which may not

  translate well to this tool. One known issue is that passing `--dry-run` is not

  supported, but others may apply as well.


  This tool necessarily has to call `cabal-install` twice, once to calculate the

  dependencies, and then to install them. It''s theoretically possible that

  `cabal-install` could come up with different build plans between the two calls,

  in which case the second call may download some packages insecurely. I''ve

  opened [cabal issue #2566](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2566) about

  disabling downloading in cabal.


  The output from `cabal install --dry-run` doesn''t actually give us information

  on which packages need to be downloaded, only the packages to be installed.

  This will be different in the case of local packages. Unfortunately, `cabal

  fetch` won''t work for us either, since it accepts different arguments [see #2](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-install/issues/2).

  The compromise we have

  now is to just continue working in the presence of errors during download,

  though a more robust solution would be to check if one of the arguments refers

  to a local package.


  ## Why not fix cabal?


  Hopefully cabal will get fixed soon, the [discussion has already

  started](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/cabal-devel/2015-April/010124.html).

  It''s unfortunately unclear how long that discussion will take, and I received a

  specific request to write this tool. Since it''s a small amount of code, I went

  ahead with this as an interim solution.


  That said, some of the future enhancements discussed below are not planned for

  cabal, in which case this tool will continue to remain relevant for people

  looking for additional security beyond transport security.


  ## Why Stackage?


  See [the same question and its answer on stackage-update](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-update#why-stackage).


  ## Future enhancements


  * Check hashes of all packages downloaded against a collection of package hashes

  * Verify signatures from authors against the [signature archive](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/sig-archive)
