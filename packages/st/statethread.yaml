description: ! 'The ST monad and STRefs in a portable form.

  This package implements state threads as wrapper around IO and IORefs.

  Your compiler must support rank-2-types, IORefs,

  unsafePerformIO and unsafeInterleaveIO.

  The package can be used as drop-in replacement for the ''st'' package.'
