synopsis: Stream postgresql-query results using the streaming library
changelog: ! "# Revision history for streaming-postgresql-simple\n\n## 0.2.0.2  --
  2018-01-02\n\n* Increase upper-bound of `streaming` to allow for 0.2\n\n## 0.2.0.1\n\nIncrease
  upper bound of `base`.\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-02-03\n\n### Correctly perform finalisation
  in `query` functions.\n\nThe previous implementation would perform the necessary
  finalisation only if the\nstream was drained. Some handling was in-place such that
  exceptions wouldn't\ncause the stream to end prematurely, but this isn't enough.
  We now use \n`MonadResource` to register an action to drain the stream.\n\nUsers
  should now wrap calls using `query` with `runResourceT`:\n\n```haskell\n>>> runResourceT
  (S.mapM_ print (query c \"SELECT * FROM t\"))\n```\n\n### Correctly deal with transactions
  in `stream`\n\n`stream` requires a transaction in order to function. If there isn't
  a \ntransaction open, `stream` would create one, but if you manually called `commit`\nor
  `rollback` from within the stream, the internal state would become \ninconsistent.
  This would lead to confusing error messages.\n\nWe now watch the transaction state
  as we pull items out from the stream, and\ninform the user if the internal state
  is not what we expected. Further more,\ncleanup actions (commit/rolling back the
  transaction) now only happen if there\nis still a transaction open. \n\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  \ -- 2017-02-02\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world. Mwahaha.\n"
