description: ! 'When <https://stripe.com/ Stripe> sends an event to your webhook,
  it

  includes an HTTP header named @Stripe-Signature@. You should use this

  to verify the authenticity of the request to ensure that you are not

  acting upon forged events originating from some source other than

  Stripe.'
