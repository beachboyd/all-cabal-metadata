description: ! 'An HTTP server can be defined as a request parser, which produces
  a response,

  while managing the application state.

  As simple as that.

  This library exploits that fact to produce a very simple and flexible API,

  which can be executed on top of any specific HTTP-server implementation (e.g., Warp).


  [Library Structure]

  The API is split into a set of DSLs targeted at solving specific problems in isolation,

  thus facilitating a proper separation of concerns.


  [Server Bindings]

  Currently only a binding to WAI and Warp is known:

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/strelka-wai>.


  [Demo]

  For a thorough demonstration of the library and suggested usage patterns
