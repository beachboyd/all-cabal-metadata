description: ! "simple-observer\n===============\n\nThis is a Haskell implementation
  of the Observer design pattern [1,2],\nproviding a typeclass and an example implementation
  (Synchronous)\nwhich is perfectly usable in its own right.\n\nThis package is based
  on Observable.hs by Bastiaan Heeren [3],\noriginally published as part of an exercise
  [4] for his students.  It\nhas been modified, extended and packaged by Andy Gimblett
  [5,6].\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Implement a mechanism for removal of observers.  Consider
  Tom\n  Lokhorst's suggestion on haskell-cafe [7].\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n2009.11.11
  v0.0.1 - first release, renamed from observer to\n                    simple-observer
  in recognition that there are more\n                    sophisticated ways to skin
  this particular cat.\n\n2009.10.30 v0.0.0 - first Cabalised version, unreleased.\n\n--\n\n[1]
