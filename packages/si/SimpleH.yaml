description: ! 'SimpleH : A simple Haskell for the simple programmer

  ====================================================


  The Haskell Prelude is a very useful library that is automatically

  loaded when compiling a Haskell source file. It defines most of the

  functions that are needed to write a simple Haskell program, including

  numeric functions, list functions, I/O functions and fundamental

  control structures (Monads, Functors and the like).


  SimpleH isn''t meant to replace the Prelude but to complement it.

  However, it redefines some standard classes in order to simplify their

  functionality so it may not interact nicely with other libraries that

  make use of the standard bindings. Still, I tried to keep the

  redefining to a minimum and to render the SimpleH experience as

  seamless as possible.


  _Warning:_ since I started writing SimpleH just a few weeks back,

  I haven''t taken the time to properly document it yet, so you have to

  already be familiar with basic Haskell concepts in order to understand

  it. Sorry.
