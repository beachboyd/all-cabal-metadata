description: ! 'Affine spaces and vector spaces with a few basic instances.


  This library implements affine spaces and vector spaces. Two instances are

  provided for affine spaces (points) and two more for vector spaces (vectors).

  These definitions are strict, implement deepseq, and are designed to have

  minimal memory overhead.'
