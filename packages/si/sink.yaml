description: ! 'Lazy I/O conflates evaluation with execution; a

  value obtained from ''unsafeInterleaveIO'' can

  perform side-effects during the evaluation of

  pure code. Like lazy I/O, a ''Sink'' provides a way

  to obtain the value of the result of an ''IO''

  action before the action has been executed, but

  unlike lazy I/O, it does not enable pure code to

  perform side-effects. Instead, the value is

  explicitly assigned by a later ''IO'' action.'
