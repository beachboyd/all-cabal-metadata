  Rounding rationals to significant digits and decimal places.


  The ''round'' function from the prelude returns an integer. The standard librarys

  of C and C++ have round functions that return floating point numbers. Rounding

  in this library takes and returns ''Rational''s and can round to a number of

  significant digits or a number of decimal places.
