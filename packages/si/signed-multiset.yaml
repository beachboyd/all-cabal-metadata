synopsis: Multisets with negative membership.
changelog: ! "version 0.4:\n\n* Removed the dependency on packages base >= 4.5.0 &&
  < 4.7.\n\n* Added a dependency on package base == 4.7.*.\n\n* Removed the Data.Typeable.Typeable1
  instance for\n  Data.SignedMultiset.SignedMultiset as the class Data.Typeable.Typeable
  no\n  longer exist.\n\n* Added a Data.Typeable.Typeable instance for\n  Data.SignedMultiset.SignedMultiset.\n\nversion
  0.3.0.1:\n\n* Asserted compatability with packages base-4.6.* and containers-0.5.*.\n\nversion
  0.3:\n\n* Removed the functions Data.SignedMultiset.isProperSubmapOf and\n  Data.SignedMultiset.difference
  as their semantics may be confusing.\n\n* Added the function Data.SignedMultiset.root
  which returns the root set of a\n  signed multiset.\n\n* Fixed a bug in Data.SignedMultiset.unitstep:
  objects with negative\n  multiplicities in the argument multiset are now correctly
  left out of the\n  returned multiset.\n\n* Fixed a bug in Data.SignedMultiset.multiply:
  multiply 0 s correctly yields the\n  empty multiset now.\n\n* Added the function
  Data.SignedMultiset.additiveMap. In case distinct elements\n  are mapped to the
  same new element, this function sets the multiplicity of the\n  new element to the
  sum of the multiplicities of the two original elements. In\n  contrast, Data.SignedMultiset.map
  selects the maximum of the nonzero\n  multiplicities of the original elements.\n\nversion
  0.2.0.1:\n\n* Fixed a bug in the implementation of the function\n  Data.SignedMultiset.difference.
  Before the fix, it would incorrectly keep\n  copies of elements of the second argument
  multiset if these elements were not\n  members of the first argument multiset, rather
  than deleting them from the\n  returned multiset.\n\nversion 0.2:\n\n* Added the
  functions Data.SignedMultiset.isPositive and\n  Data.SignedMultiset.isNegative,
  which return whether all elements in a\n  signed multiset have respectively nonnegative
  or nonpositive multiplicity.\n\n* Added the functions Data.SignedMultiset.shadow,
  Data.SignedMultiset.modulus,\n  Data.SignedMultiset.signum, and Data.SignedMultiset.unitstep
  which return\n  respecitively the additive inverse, modulus, signum, and left-continuous
  unit\n  step of a signed multiset.\n\n* Added the functions Data.SignedMultiset.filter,
  Data.SignedMultiset.partition,\n  and Data.SignedMultiset.split for filtering and
  partitioning signed\n  multisets.\n\n* Added the functions Data.SignedMultiset.foldr'
  and Data.SignedMultiset.foldl',\n  which are strict versions of Data.SignedMultiset.foldr
  and\n  Data.SignedMultiset.foldl.\n\n* Changed the behaviour of both the function
  Data.SignedMultiset.fromList and\n  the Read instance of Data.SignedMultiset: it
  multiple element/multiplicity\n  pairs are provided for the same element, the multiplicity
  of the element in\n  the constructed multiset is now taken to be the sum of the
  provided\n  multiplicities (rather than the rightmost multiplicity).\n\n* Added
  the functions Data.SignedMultiset.toLists and\n  Data.SignedMultiset.fromLists,
  which convert between signed multisets and\n  pairs of lists of elements with positive
  and negative multiplicity.\n\n* Made the dependency on the base and containers packages
  more restrictive. The\n  dependency for base now carries the version constraint
  == 4.5.*, while the\n  dependency for containers now comes with the constraint >=
  0.4.2 && < 0.5.\n\nversion 0.1:\n\n* Initial release.\n"

description: ! 'Multisets (or bags) are sets in which elements may occur more than
  once.

  The number of times an element occurs in a multiset is called its

  /multiplicity/.


  This package provides an efficient implementation of so-called

  /signed multisets/ (also known as hybrid sets or shadow sets), which

  generalise multisets by allowing for /negative membership/.

  That is, elements in a signed multiset can have negative multiplicities.
