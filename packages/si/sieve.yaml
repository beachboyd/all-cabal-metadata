description: A Sieve is a data type with properties analogous to a physical Sieve
  and it is useful for building up lists of data wherein a specific constraint must
  be met that cannot be achieved using normal type semantics. A Sieve encapsulates
  a list that can only hold a certain type, specified by a identity function and is
  preferable to creating or building up lists by using conditional blocks or by the
  progressive use of filter. This is especially advantageous if a list is to be passed
  around and used as an accumulator. In such a configuration, the original declaring
  type is passed around with the Sieve so that it can be used transparently in subsequent
  areas of the program.
