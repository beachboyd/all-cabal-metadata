description: ! 'TemplateHaskell is fairly useful for generating new

  Haskell code. This, however, can incur a dependency on

  TH on subsequent uses where none theoretically should exist.

  ZeroTH solves this by scanning a file for top-level TH

  declarations, evaluates them, removes TH imports, and outputs

  the resulting code.'
