description: |-
  This is my own custom prelude. It is not intended to be suitable
  for all projects, but is designed to be an acceptable dependency
  for any library project, so that I can use it unconditionally. Its
  only dependency is base, and it just re-exports things from various
  modules scattered about the base package that I don't want to have
  to import.
