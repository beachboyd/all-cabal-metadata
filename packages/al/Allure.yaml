description: ! "Allure of the Stars\n===================\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AllureOfTheStars/Allure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AllureOfTheStars/Allure)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/Allure.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Allure)\n[![Join
  the chat at https://gitter.im/AllureOfTheStars/Allure](https://badges.gitter.im/AllureOfTheStars/Allure.svg)](https://gitter.im/AllureOfTheStars/Allure?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nAllure
  of the Stars is a near-future Sci-Fi roguelike[2]\nand tactical squad game. Binaries
  and the game manual\nare available at the homepage[6], where you can also\ntry the
  game out in the browser: http://allureofthestars.com/play\n(It runs fastest on Chrome.
  Keyboard commands and savefiles\nare supported only on recent enough versions of
  browsers.\nMouse should work everywhere.)\n\n![gameplay screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllureOfTheStars/media/master/screenshot/allureofthestars.com.ambush.gif)\n\nNot
  a single picture in this game. You have to imagine everything\nyourself, like with
  a book (a grown-up book, without pictures).\nOnce you learn to imagine things, though,
  you can keep exploring\nand mastering the world and making up stories for a long
  time.\n\nThe game is written in Haskell[1] using the LambdaHack[10]\nroguelike game
  engine.\nPlease see the changelog file for recent improvements\nand the issue tracker
  for short-term plans. Long term goals\nare high replayability and auto-balancing
  through procedural\ncontent generation and persistent content modification\nbased
  on player behaviour. Contributions are welcome.\n\n\nGame installation from binary
  archives\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe game runs rather slowly
  in the browser (fastest on Chrome)\nand you are limited to only one font, though
  it's scalable.\nAlso, savefiles are prone to corruption on the browser,\ne.g., when
  it's closed while the game is still saving progress\n(which takes a long time).
  Hence, after trying out the game,\nyou may prefer to use a native binary for your
  architecture, if it exists.\n\nPre-compiled game binaries are available through\nthe
  release page[11] (and continuously from AppVeyor[18]).\nNote that Windows binaries
  no longer work on Windows XP, since Cygwin\nand MSYS2 dropped support for XP. To
  use a pre-compiled binary archive,\nunpack it and run the executable in the unpacked
  directory\nor use program shortcuts from the installer, if available.\n\nOn Linux,
  make sure you have the SDL2 libraries installed on your system\n(e.g., libsdl2-2.0-0,
  libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 on Ubuntu; also libdw1).\nFor Windows, the SDL2 and all other
  needed libraries are already contained\nin the game's binary archive.\n\n\nScreen
  and keyboard configuration\n---------------------------------\n\nThe game UI can
  be configured via a config file.\nThe default settings, the same that are built
  into the binary,\nare in [GameDefinition/config.ui.default](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/GameDefinition/config.ui.default).\nWhen
  the game is run for the first time, the file is copied to the default\nuser data
  folder, which is `~/.Allure/` on Linux,\n`C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Allure\\`\n(or
  `C:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Allure\\`\nor something else
  altogether) on Windows, and in RMB menu, under\n`Inspect/Application/Local Storage`
  when run inside the Chrome browser.\n\nScreen font can be changed by editing the
  config file in the user\ndata folder. For a small game window, the highly optimized\n16x16x.fon
  and 8x8x.fon bitmap fonts are the best,\nbut for larger window sizes or if you require
  international characters\n(e.g. to give custom names to player characters), a modern
  scalable font\nsupplied with the game is the only option. The game window automatically\nscales
  according to the specified font size.\n\nIf you don't have a numeric keypad, you
  can use mouse or laptop keys\n(uk8o79jl) for movement or you can enable the Vi keys
  (aka roguelike keys)\nin the config file. If numeric keypad doesn't work, toggling\nthe
  Num Lock key sometimes helps. If running with the Shift key\nand keypad keys doesn't
  work, try Control key instead.\nThe game is fully playable with mouse only, as well
  as with keyboard only,\nbut the most efficient combination for some players is mouse
  for go-to,\ninspecting, and aiming at distant positions and keyboard for everything
  else.\n\n\nCompilation from source\n-----------------------\n\nIf you want to compile
  native binaries from the source code,\nuse Cabal (already a part of your OS distribution,
  or available within\nThe Haskell Platform[7]), which also takes care of all the
  dependencies.\n\nThe recommended frontend is based on SDL2, so you need the SDL2
  libraries\nfor your OS. On Linux, remember to install the -dev versions as well,\ne.g.,
  libsdl2-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev on Ubuntu Linux 16.04.\n(Compilation to JavaScript
  for the browser is more complicated\nand requires the ghcjs[15] compiler and optionally
  the Google Closure\nCompiler[16] as well.)\n\nThe latest official version of the
  game can be downloaded,\ncompiled for SDL2 and installed automatically by Cabal
  from Hackage[3]\nas follows\n\n    cabal update\n    cabal install Allure\n\nFor
  a newer version, install a matching LambdaHack library snapshot\nfrom a development
  branch, download the game source from github[5]\nand run `cabal install` from the
  main directory.\n\n\nTesting and debugging\n---------------------\n\nThe [Makefile](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/Makefile)\ncontains
  many sample test commands.\nNumerous tests that use the screensaver game modes (AI
  vs. AI)\nand the teletype frontend are gathered in `make test`.\nOf these, travis
  runs `test-travis` on each push to github.\nTest commands with prefix `frontend`
  start AI vs. AI games\nwith the standard, user-friendly frontend.\n\nRun `Allure
  --help` to see a brief description of all debug options.\nOf these, the `--sniff`
  option is very useful (though verbose\nand initially cryptic), for displaying the
  traffic between clients\nand the server. Some options in the config file may prove
  useful too,\nthough they mostly overlap with commandline options (and will be totally\nmerged
  at some point).\n\n\nCoding style\n------------\n\nStylish Haskell is used for slight
  auto-formatting at buffer save; see\n[.stylish-haskell.yaml](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/.stylish-haskell.yaml).\nAs
  defined in the file, indentation is 2 spaces wide and screen is\n80-columns wide.
  Spaces are used, not tabs. Spurious whitespace avoided.\nSpaces around arithmetic
  operators encouraged.\nGenerally, relax and try to stick to the style apparent in
  a file\nyou are editing. Put big formatting changes in separate commits.\n\nHaddocks
  are provided for all module headers and for all functions and types\nfrom major
  modules, in particular the modules that are interfaces\nfor a whole directory of
  modules. Apart of that, only very important\nfunctions and types are distinguished
  by having a haddock.\nIf minor ones have comments, they should not be haddocks\nand
  they are permitted to describe implementation details and be out of date.\nPrefer
  assertions to comments, unless too verbose.\n\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\nFor
  more information, visit the wiki[4]\nand see [PLAYING.md](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/GameDefinition/PLAYING.md),\n[CREDITS](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/CREDITS)\nand
