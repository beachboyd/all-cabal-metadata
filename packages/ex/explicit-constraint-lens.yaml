description: ! 'A snowclone of the great <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens
  lens>

  library. It implements the full hierarchy from isomorphisms to

  setters and folds, but instead of the Van Laarhoven implementation with

  universally-quantified functor mappings (powerful and elegant, but

  infamously beginner-scaring), it encapsulates the various

  realworld-usecase signatures like get+set or build+distinguish

  in a well-confined type family and expresses the relations between the

  different optics explicitly, with a dedicated class hierarchy.


  See <https://github.com/leftaroundabout/explicit-constraint-lens/blob/master/README.md
  the Readme>

  for details on how this library differs from the alternatives. See

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/explicit-constraint-lens/docs/Lens-Explicit.html
  the Haddocks>

  to learn how to use it.'
