description: ! 'This package contains:


  * Existential datatypes for holding evidence of constraints on types of kind @*@
  and @* -> *@;


  * Type classes for existential datatypes holding evidence of constraints on types
  of kind @*@ and @* -> *@;


  * Completely useless existential datatypes holding evidence of no constraint on
  types of kind @*@ and @* -> *@;


  * Assorted type class instances for the above;


  * A type-level combinator for combining constraint constructors.


  (Some of these might be better off as separate packages.)


  "Data.Exists" has most of the important things.


  Minimum GHC: 7.4


  Changes in 0.2:


  * Removed @Comonad@-related things (they were probably useless anyways)


  * Added @Data.Exists.CPS@'
