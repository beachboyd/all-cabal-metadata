  Framework for Exact Real Arithmetic in the Positional Number System (Base 2, digits
  -1, 0, 1)


  Most implementations of exact real arithmetic are using continued fractions to

  represent computable reals. Exact real arithmetic with a positional number

  system was the original concept in Alan Turing''s "On Computable Numbers".

  The positional number system has some more or less obvious advantages over

  continued fractions. This software was developed during my bachelor thesis

  and should not be useful in this early stage, except for demo purposes.
