description: ! 'The documentation of "System.Environment.getProgName" says that

  \"However, this is hard-to-impossible to implement on some non-Unix OSes,

  so instead, for maximum portability, we just return the leafname

  of the program as invoked.\"

  This library tries to provide the missing path.

  Note: Since base 4.6.0.0, there is also a function

  "System.Environment.getExecutablePath".'
