description: ! 'Extensible lists: Add to a list at compile-time in many modules, which

  do not necessarily know each other, and then collect it into a single

  list in a module depending on all of them (possibly indirectly).


  Extensible products: It is a record in which new fields can be added

  anywhere including in different modules; dependent defaults are

  supported, so it is still possible to make a value of such a type.


  Extensible sums: Type with choices; new choices can be added anywhere

  including in other modules (which do not need to know each other). The

  operations on them are also freely extensible in the similar way.


  Extensible trees: You can make a tree out of types, and have a value at

  each node. New nodes can be added anywhere if you have access to the

  node which will become the new node''s parent.'
