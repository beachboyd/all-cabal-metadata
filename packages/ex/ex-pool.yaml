description: ! "# ex-pool\n\nA fork of [resource-pool](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resource-pool)\nproviding
  a high-performance striped resource pooling implementation for\nHaskell.\n\nThe
  package is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the original\nversion, for when
  the following properties seem useful:\n\n  * Unlike the original implementation,
  this library enables actions to be run\n    in `MonadIO` (instead of plain `IO`),
  and uses\n    [exceptions](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/exceptions) for exception\n
  \   handling.\n\n  * Also, a number of yet-to-be-released enhancements and fixes
  to the original\n    library are included (namely [#11](https://github.com/bos/pool/pull/11),\n
  \   [#15](https://github.com/bos/pool/pull/15),\n    [#16](https://github.com/bos/pool/pull/16)).\n\nThat
  is, if you don't need any of the above, use the original package :)\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease
  report [issues here](https://github.com/kim/ex-pool/issues), or, better\nyet, submit
  [pull requests](https://github.com/kim/ex-pool/pulls).\n\n# License\n\nBSD3, see
