  A library of extra functions for the standard Haskell libraries. Most functions
  are simple additions, filling out missing functionality. A few functions are available
  in later versions of GHC, but this package makes them available back to GHC 7.2.
  A few examples:


  * `Control.Monad.Extra.concatMapM` provides a monadic version of `concatMap`, in
  the same way that `mapM` is a monadic version of `map`.

  * `Data.Tuple.Extra.fst3` provides a function to get the first element of a triple.

  * `Control.Exception.Extra.retry` provides a function that retries an `IO` action
  a number of times.

  * `System.Environment.Extra.lookupEnv` is a function available in GHC 7.6 and above.
  On GHC 7.6 and above this package reexports the version from `System.Environment`
  while on GHC 7.4 and below it defines an equivalent version.


  The module `Extra` documents all functions provided by this library. Modules such
  as `Data.List.Extra` provide extra functions over `Data.List` and also reexport
  `Data.List`. Users are recommended to replace `Data.List` imports with `Data.List.Extra`
  if they need the extra functionality.



  ## Which functions?


  When producing a library of extra functions I have been guided by a few principles.
  I encourage others with small useful utility functions contribute them here, perhaps
  as a temporary stop before proposing they join the standard libraries.


  * I have been using most of these functions in my packages - they have proved useful
  enough to be worth copying/pasting into each project.

  * The functions follow the spirit of the original Prelude/base libraries. I am happy
  to provide partial functions (e.g. `fromRight`), and functions which are specialisations
  of more generic functions (`whenJust`).

  * Most of the functions have trivial implementations. If a beginner couldn''t write
  the function, it probably doesn''t belong here.

  * I have defined only a few new data types or type aliases. It''s a package for
  defining new utilities on existing types, not new types or concepts.



  ## Base versions


  The following GHC versions correspond to the following base library versions:


  * base 4.9 == GHC 8.0

  * base 4.8 == GHC 7.10

  * base 4.7 == GHC 7.8

  * base 4.6 == GHC 7.6

  * base 4.5 == GHC 7.4

  * base 4.4 == GHC 7.2
