description: ! "Haskell LLVM bindings\n---------------------\n\nThis package provides
  Haskell bindings for the popular\n[LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler infrastructure
  project.\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nWe try to stay up to date with LLVM
  releases.  The current version of\nthis package is compatible with LLVM 2.9 and
  2.8.  Please understand\nthat the package may or may not work against older LLVM
  releases; we\ndon't have the time or resources to test across multiple releases.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nBy
  default, when you run `cabal install`, the Haskell bindings will be\nconfigured
  to look for LLVM in `/usr/local`.\n\nIf you have LLVM installed in a different location,
  e.g. `/usr`, you\ncan tell the `configure` script where to find it as follows:\n\n
  \   cabal install --configure-option=--with-llvm-prefix=/usr\n\n\nPackage status
  - what to expect\n-------------------------------\n\nThis package is still under
  development.\n\nThe high level bindings are currently incomplete, so there are some\nlimits
  on what you can do.  Adding new functions is generally easy,\nthough, so don't be
  afraid to get your hands dirty.\n\nThe high level interface is mostly safe, but
  the type system cannot\nprotect against everything that can go wrong, so take care.
  \ And, of\ncourse, there's no way to guarantee anything about the generated code.\n\n\nGHCi\n----\n\nllvm-base
  will not work under GHCi. It fails to resolve some symbols,\nhowever under GHC it
  works fine. It appears related to the bugs listed in:\n\nhttp://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3333\nhttp://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3658\nhttp://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5987\n\nghci
  versions < 7.7 have their own special linker, we do not support it.\nghci versions
  >= 7.7 use the system dynamic linker, we do support it.\nIf you have a problem using
  llvm-base with ghci >= 7.7 please file a bug report.\n\nStaying in touch\n----------------\n\nThere
  is a low-volume mailing list named\n[haskell-llvm@projects.haskellorg](http://projects.haskell.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/haskell-llvm).\nIf
  you use the LLVM bindings, you should think about joining.\n\nIf you want to contribute
  patches, please clone a copy of the\n[git repository](https://github.com/bos/llvm):\n\n
  \   git clone git://github.com/bos/llvm\n\nPatches are best submitted via the github
  \"pull request\" interface.\n\nTo file a bug or a request for an enhancement, please
  use the\n[github issue tracker](https://github.com/bos/llvm/issues).\n"
