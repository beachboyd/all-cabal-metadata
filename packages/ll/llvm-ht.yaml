description: ! "Haskell LLVM bindings\n---------------------\n\nThis package provides
  Haskell bindings for the popular LLVM compiler\ninfrastructure project.  If you
  don't know what LLVM is, the main LLVM\nhome page is here:\n\n  http://llvm.org/\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nBy
  default, when you run \"runghc Setup configure\", the Haskell\nbindings will be
  configured to install to /usr/local.  The configure\nscript will look for your LLVM
  installation in that same directory.\n\nIf you have LLVM installed in a different
  location, e.g. /usr, you can\ntell the configure script where to find it as follows:\n\n
  \ runghc Setup configure --configure-option=--with-llvm-prefix=/usr\n\n\nPackage
  status - what to expect\n-------------------------------\n\nThis package is still
  under development.\n\nThe high level bindings are currently incomplete, so there
  are some\nlimits on what you can do.  Adding new functions is generally easy,\nthough,
  so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.\n\nThe high level interface is mostly
  safe, but the type system cannot\nprotect against everything that can go wrong,
  so take care.  And, of\ncourse, there's no way to guarantee anything about the generated
  code.\n\n\nJump in and help!\n-----------------\n\nWe welcome your comments and
  contributions.  You can send email to us\nat <bos@serpentine.com> or <lennart@augustsson.net>.
  \ If you want to\nsend patches, please get a copy of the darcs repository:\n\n  darcs
