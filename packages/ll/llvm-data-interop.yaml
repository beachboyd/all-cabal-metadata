description: ! "This package converts the LLVM IR (either bitcode files or LLVM\nassembly)
  into a Haskell data type (defined in llvm-base-types).  The\nconversion uses the
  LLVM libraries to read bitcode.  It then traverses\nthe IR and produces a Haskell
  structure that can be pattern matched\nagainst in pure code.\n\nAfter the conversion,
  no C++ data is referenced and no C++ code is\ncalled.  This library does link against
  LLVM directly, and therefore\nalso uses libstdc++.  This can make linking tricky
  sometimes.  For\nexample, mixing template-haskell with C++-linked code does not
  seem to\nwork.\n\nNote that this library only works with LLVM 3.0-3.3, and will
  try to\nretain as much compatibility with future and past versions as is\nreasonable.\n\n#
  Installation Notes\n\n * Currently, this library is set up to link against the LLVM
  shared\n   library (libLLVM-3.X.so).  Most distro packages build the LLVM\n   shared
  library.  If you make a custom build, be sure to configure\n   with `--enable-shared`.\n\n##
  Debian and Ubuntu\n\nYou need the development libraries and headers, so be sure
  to install\nthe llvm-3.X-dev package, where X is the version you would like to\nuse.
  \ You will also need clang.\n\n# Changes\n\n## v0.3.0\n\n * Support LLVM-3.3 (contributed
  by Patrick Hulin)\n * Minor breaking change in MetaDW*Type.  These no longer have
  a\n   MetaDWFile; instead, they directly contain their file and directory\n   information.\n"
