  # Change log for the `llvm-tf` package

  ## 9.0

  * `Instructions.bitcastElements`:
    Use `Guided.bitcast Guided.vector` instead.

  * `Core.Guided`: new module for instructions on both scalars and vectors

  * fixed bug: `cmp` on `IntN` did an unsigned comparison

  * `Vector`: instance `QuickCheck.Arbitrary`

  ## 3.1.2

  * `Instructions`: setters for FastMath flags

  ## 3.1.0.1

  * `addFunctionMapping` checks for functions
    that are eliminated by optimization passes.
    This fixes a crash when working with optimizations and call-back functions.

  ## 3.1

  * `ExecutionEngine` is now managed by a `ForeignPtr` with a finalizer.
    That is, you must keep the `ExecutionEngine` alive
    as long as you call compiled functions.

    `FreePointers` and `getFreePointers` are gone.

  ## 3.0.3

  * `constVector`, `constArray`, `vector` do no longer cycle the vector
    Instead they check for the appropriate static length.

  * `FFI.constVector`, `FFI.constArray` must be in IO
    in order to proper sequence actions in `Core.Util.constVector`, `Core.Util.constArray`.
    Currently, in `Util.constVector` it is possible that `FFI.constArray`
    is called too late and thus operates on a released pointer.

  High-level bindings to the LLVM compiler toolkit
  using type families instead of functional dependencies.

  We use the same module names as the @llvm@ package,
  which makes it harder to work with both packages from GHCi.
  You may use the @-hide-package@ option.
  We may change the module names later.

  A note on versioning:
  The versions of this package are loosely based on the LLVM version.
  However, we depend on a relatively stable part of LLVM
  and provide a relatively stable API for it.
  We conform to the Package Versioning Policy PVP,
  i.e. we increase the version of this package when its API changes,
  but not necessarily when we add support for a new LLVM version.
  We support all those LLVM versions
  that are supported by our @llvm-ffi@ dependency.
