description: ! 'This package defines types used in the llvm-analysis and

  llvm-data-interop packages.


  This is a separate package mostly because llvm-data-interop needed to

  be split out due to C++ linkage issues.  llvm-data-interop needs the

  definitions in this packages but cannot depend on llvm-analysis (which

  also needs these types).


  Further, to avoid code duplication some of the C++ enumeration values

  used in llvm-data-interop are actually included with this package.

  The definitions in this package are used (via c2hs) to build Haskell

  equivalents.  The base types need these definitions, but the

  llvm-data-interop package also needs to be able to find the header.

  This is handled in Setup.hs in llvm-data-interop with cooperation from

  this package (which exports the cabal-generated path to the installed

  header).


  Only llvm-data-interop and llvm-analysis should ever need to reference

  this package since llvm-analysis re-exports all of the definitions.
