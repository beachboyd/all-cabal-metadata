description: ! 'Fst is an application for construction and running of finite state

  transducers, as based on the concepts of transducers and regular

  relations developed by Xerox.  The syntax of Xerox''s fst program has

  functioned as an inspiration for the syntax of fstStudio.


  The application was written purely in Haskell, and is intended to be

  a tool for the Haskell programmer, especially for ones that develop

  language applications.


  This package provides an interactive shell for parsing transducers

  specified in a specialized FST language. See "FST.FSTStudio".


  This package also provides a programmer''s interface for building and

  applying transducers. See "FST.TransducerInterface".'
