description: "# A haskell package in model checking\n\nThis is the repo for the package
  I developed in haskell as the project for my dissertation. The package consists
  in the following three parts:\n\n### FSM.Automata\n\nIn this module, we define the
  `data Automata` so it is possible to construct an Automata, perform basic operations
  with it or get information from it.\n\n### FSM.States\n\nIn this module we strongly
  use the [Data Map](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.2.1/docs/Data-Map-Strict.html)
  package to store information in the states. Although this module may seem simple,
  it took a lot of hours of designing.\n\nI decided to keep the packages independents
  from each other so you can use one without having to use the other. Because of this,
  it is possible to create an `AutomataInfo` object of an `Automata` that is not even
  defined.\n\n### FSM.Logic\n\nIn this final module, we combine the two previous modules
  and some functions implemented in them so we can apply the CTL model checking algorithm
  over the `Automata` and the `AutomataInfo`. \n"
