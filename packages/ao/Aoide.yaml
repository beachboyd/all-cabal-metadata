description: |-
  This library provides data structures for describing music and generates Lilypond and MIDI files. In addition, it contains a
  module with some music-theoretical functions that may be useful in computer-assisted composition. The library is focused on
  the very basics of standard Western musical notation and does not support dynamic indications, articulation marks, double
  accidentals, tempo changes, polyrhythms, time signature changes and microtonality. Tuplets are supported in MIDI scores but
  not in Lilypond scores. Some features, like key changes and polytonality, can be used but not properly notated.
