synopsis: Applications for interacting with the Pushbullet API
changelog: ! "# Revision history for tpb\n\n## 0.4.0.0  -- 2017-08-01\n\n* Bump dependency
  on servant-pushbullet-client and pushbullet-types to 0.4.\n  This version includes
  important fixes for parsing pushes sent by channels and\n  link pushes without bodies.\n*
  pb-notify: Improve formatting of notification text for link pushes.\n\n## 0.3.0.0
  \ -- 2017-07-29\n\n* implement clipboard integration in pb-notify via a built-in
  HTTP server.\n* add script pbclip for interacting with the pushbullet clipboard
  via\n  pb-notify.\n* tpb: add `devices create` and `devices remove` commands\n*
  tpb: support pushbullet-types 0.3\n* bump dependency on servant-pushbullet-client
  to 0.3\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-04-30\n\n* Partially fix connectivity bugs in pb-notify.\n*
  Mirror pushes in pb-notify.\n\n## 0.1.1.1  -- 2017-02-20\n\n* add `app_name` libnotify
  hint in pb-notify, so applications processing\n  notifications sent by pb-notify
  can do special logic.\n\n## 0.1.1.0  -- 2017-02-20\n\n* remove unused module.\n*
  declare all modules in `other-modules` so cabal includes them in source\n  distributions.\n\n##
  0.1.0.0  -- 2017-02-20\n\nThis version releases the `tpb` and `pb-notify` programs
  as well as some\naccompanying scripts.\n\n### tpb features\n\n* multiple output
  formats:\n  * for standalone usage, nice human-readable formatting; and\n  * for
  usage in scripts, tabular output as JSON separated values.\n* list devices.\n* list
  SMS threads on a device.\n* list contents of an SMS thread on a device, either:\n
  \ * by thread ID; or\n  * by fuzzy-matching the recipient's name to find the thread
  ID.\n* send SMS, either :\n  * by giving an explicit phone number; or\n  * by fuzzy-matching
  the recipient's name to find their phone number.\n\ntpb requires no configuration
  if you fill out all the command line options, but\nsome options that are used everywhere
  (like the Pushbullet API key and the\ndevice ID, assuming you use only one device)
  can be specified via environment\nvariables.\n\n### pb-notify features\n\n* API
  key configuration via environment variables.\n* Any SMS received on any Pushbullet
  device associated to the API key will be\n  shown as a desktop notification via
  libnotify.\n"

description: ! 'This package provides two programs, tpb and pb-notify, for interacting
  with

  the Pushbullet API. The former is primarily used for sending SMS whereas the

  latter is used for showing desktop notifications when SMS are received.

  tpb additionally supports a number of additional management commands for

  creating and deleting resources inside PushBullet.

  pb-notify is responsible for integration with PushBullet''s Universal

  Copy/Paste feature. It maintains an internal buffer that is kept in sync with

  PushBullet''s clipboard. This buffer can be accessed via pb-notify''s built-in

  HTTP server. A POST request to the /clip endpoint of the server will in turn

  send the necessary request to PushBullet to set the clipboard of all

  connected devices.'
