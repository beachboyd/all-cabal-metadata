description: ! "This is the bootstrapping-version of UUAGC.\nThe UUAGC tool is fully
  functional. The essential difference with the\nbootstrapped version is that this
  one is called \"uuagc-bootstrap\"\ninstead of \"uuagc\".\n\nIt should be used to
  compile the actual version of UUAG from source.\nThis package should be updated
  to prevent it from bitrotting with\nrespect to library and language changes.\nThis
  package does *not* require UUAG to be installed. Instead, it\nhas the \"derived\"
  files in the src-derived directory.\n\n\nNote about updating the boostrapping package:\n\nTo
  update it this package in the repository version some\nmanual labour is unfortunately
  required:\n* build the bootstrapped version of UUAG using cabal build.\n  This produces
  Haskell sources compiled from the AG files of the\n  src-ag directory in dist/build/uuagc/uuagc-tmp.\n*
  Copy dist/build/uuagc/uuagc-tmp/*.hs to\n  bootstrap/src-derived.\n  -> Use the
  update-derived.sh script for this.\n  Since these files are also added to the repository,
  you may want\n  to add new files also to the repository or delete obsolete files.\n*
  Update the uuagc-bootstrap.cabal file if new modules are added\n  or settings change.
  Bump the version number.\n  -> Use the update-cabalfile.sh script for this. It takes
  the\n  cabal file of the bootstrapping version and replaces some\n  lines in it
  with the x-bootstrap lines in that file.\n* Compile and publish.\n\n\nNote about
  the directory structure:\n\nsrc:          sources common to the bootstrapping and
  bootstrapped version of UUAGC\nsrc-derived:  haskell files compiled from the ag
  files of the bootstrapped version.\nsrc-version:  version information only for the
  bootstrapping version.\n"
