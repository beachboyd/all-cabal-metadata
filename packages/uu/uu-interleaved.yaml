description: ! 'This module contains parser library independent code which can be
  used to describe

  interleaved execution of applicative style structures.

  It is amongst other used in the uu-options package, which provides facilities for

  parsing command-line options or files containing preferences.

  It generalises the permuting parsers and the list merging parsers as e.g. found
  in

  the uulib library. For  a more complete description see the Technical Report

  describing its implementation and use see
