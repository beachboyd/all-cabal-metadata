changelog: |
  # Version 0.0.4

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE._ `registryConf_with` now takes a
    `Di` as extra argument.

  * _BREAKING CHANGE._ `Moto.File` registry now now takes `/foo/bar` on the
    command line, rather than `file:///foo/bar`.

  * Added `Moto.File.jsonStore`. See issue #11.

  * Added `Moto.dummyStore`. See issue #3.

  * Added `Moto.dummyBackup`. See issue #7.

  * Added `--unsafe-commit` and `--unsafe-abort` switches to the `clean` CLI.
    These can be used to force the cleanup of a dirty migration registry without
    actually running any clean-up code, which can be useful in case of manual
    recovery. See issue #13.

  * Made compatible with `di-df1` version `1.2`.

  * Improved exception logging.


  # Version 0.0.3

  * Haddocks and Hackage choke on internal Cabal libraries, so we remove the
    internal `moto-internal` library.


  # Version 0.0.2

  * Added file missing from distribution.


  # Version 0.0.1

  * Initial version.
