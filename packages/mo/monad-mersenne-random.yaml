description: ! 'Often we need an efficient way to generate high

  quality pseudo-random numbers in Haskell. We have good generators

  themselves (for example, the mersenne-random-pure64 package), however, users

  are often tempted to store the generator in a lazy state monad. This

  causes performance problems.


  This package provides an optimized ''Rand'' monad for monadic generation

  of random numbers from a state, with close attention to performance. You

  may have results an order of magnitude or more better than using

  Control.Monad.State to store your generator.'
