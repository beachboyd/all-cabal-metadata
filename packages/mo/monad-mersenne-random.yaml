description: |-
  Often we need an efficient way to generate high
  quality pseudo-random numbers in Haskell. We have good generators
  themselves (for example, the mersenne-random-pure64 package), however, users
  are often tempted to store the generator in a lazy state monad. This
  causes performance problems.

  This package provides an optimized 'Rand' monad for monadic generation
  of random numbers from a state, with close attention to performance. You
  may have results an order of magnitude or more better than using
  Control.Monad.State to store your generator.
