  * [!446](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/446)
    Include source locations and let-binding stacks into typecheck errors.
  * [!449](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/449)
    + Improve `Michelson.Test.Integrational` interface.
    + Remove `IntegrationalValidator`, `SuccessValidator`, `validate`,
      `composeValidators`, `composeValidatorsList`, `expectAnySuccess`.
    + Add `unexpectedInterpreterError`, `attempt`, `catchExpectedError`.
    + Change type of `expect*`/`tExpect*` functions.
      They now return `IntegrationalScenario` instead of `SuccessValidator` / `Bool`.
    + Rename `ValidationError` to `TestError`
    + Replace `TestError`'s `UnexpectedExecutorError` constructor with
      `InterpreterError` and `UnexpectedInterpreterError`.
  * [!441](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/441)
    Remove `tezos-bake-monitor-lib dependency`, and define value to json conversion
    using binary round trip locally instead.
  * [!448](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/448)
    Remove `base-noprelude` dependency and use mixins to hide `Prelude` instead.
  * [!367](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/367)
    Values and instructions now carry some extra constraints in order to avoid
    construction of illegally typed values from within Haskell.
    `WellTyped` now also requires `Typeable` and `SingI` constraints.
  * [!409](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/409)
    + Add hedgehog support
  * [!438](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/438)
    + Fixed parsing bug: support semicolons after block comments.

  * [!424](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/424) Changed
    contract address computation logic in the interpreter to match the
    reference implementation a bit more closely by including a global counter and
    an origination index (nonce) to contract's hash. Specifically, now the same
    contract may be originated several times, leading to different addresses,
    just like in Tezos.

  1.3.0
  =====
  * [!417](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/417)
  Change the license to MIT.
  * [!386](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/386)
    + Add a way to describe constructors and fields of ADTs in Markdown documentation.
    + Require that all contracts include documentation for the storage type.
  * [!396](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/396) Fixed
    typed `Notes` to permit pair annotations for container keys.
  * [!359](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/359) Renamed
    'FullContract' to 'Contract', removed the prefix `f` from its record fields
    and removed "Full" from the names of the functions:
    `convertFullContract`, `printTypedFullContract` and `mapFullContractCode`.
  * [!354](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/354)
    + Fix bug: add `ChainId` to `IsPrimitiveValue` type family.
    + Add `GInstrDeconstruct` type class and related functions
      which serve to deconstruct datatype into its fields on the stack.
    + Add `gInstrConstructStack` to `GInstrConstruct` type class that serves
      to construct a datatype from its fields on the stack.
    + Add `GFieldNames` type family returning list of `Symbol`s:
      the names of direct fields of datatype.

  1.2.0
  =====
  * [!343](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/343)
    + Make pairs comparable and available to use as map keys and in sets.
    + CT type has been integrated into T.
    + A `WellTyped` type class has been added to ensure that a type
      represented by  T is valid as per Michelson's rules.
  * [!358](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/358)
    Remove deprecated `STEPS_TO_QUOTA` instruction.
  * [!368](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/368)
    + Update JSON encoding of types.
    + Rename fields of the untyped `Contract'`.
  * [!286](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/286)
    Morley supports field annotations for parameter root now.
  * [!344](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/344)
    Fixed a bug in `Michelson.Analyzer` and added `linearizeLeftDeep`.

  1.1.0
  =====
  * [!337](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/337)
    Added an extension for Michelson comment to typed and untyped contract representation.
  * [!306](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/306)
    Added PAIR/UNPAIR rule to optimizer.
  * [!314](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/314)
    Fixed a bug in the implementation of `MAP` operation: it did not preserve modifications to
    stack.
  * [!261](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/261)
    Slightly modified interpreter API.
  * [!313](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/313)
    Made `typeCheckValue` polymorphic in desired type, instead of using
    existential wrappers.
  * [!310](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/232)
    + Add `DGeneralInfoSection` documentation section with git revision and
      potentially other info.
    + Add `buildLorentzDocWithGitRev` and `buildInstrDocWithGitRev` to
      API to add a git revision to contract docs from the executable.
  * [!121](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/302)
    `BALANCE` instruction now returns the balance with funds from incoming
    transaction.
  * [!294](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/294)
    + Added `Paths_*` modules to `autogen-modules` in cabal files.  Removed `-O0`
    + from default GHC options. Please set `ghc-options` in your `stack.yaml` or
    `cabal.project.local`.
  * [!271](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/271) Renamed
    'Contract' to 'ContractCode', and appended "Code" to the names of two functions:
    'convertContract' and 'printTypedContract'
  * [!278](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/278)
    Added some utilities for command line option parsing, see `Util.CLI` and `Morley.CLI` modules.
  * [!268](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/268)
    Test functions which import typed contract now return `FullContract` instead
    of `Contract`, thus preserving parameter and storage annotations. In case you
    don't need this behaviour, use `fcCode` for conversion.
    Test functions which import Lorentz contracts have been removed because they
    cannot be implemented sanely, and Lorentz is assumed to be used to generate
    code, do not use it for work with textual Michelson contracts.
  * [!212](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/212)
    + Fix `AND` instruction return type.
    + Add `DUP n` macro support.
    + Fix `LAMBDA` instruction printer.
  * [!265](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/265)
    The semicolons between instructions are now optional.

  1.0.0
  =====

  * [!215](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/215)
    Major change: all Lorentz functionality was moved into `lorentz` package.
    A small portion of testing library code was moved around (from `Lorentz.*` to `Michelson.*` or vice versa).

  0.7.0
  =====

  * [!237](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/237)
    The `option (nat %foo)` is now accepted syntax. The `%foo` is ignored.
  * [!241](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/241)
    Derive `Show` instance for `Void_`.
  * [!238](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/238)
    + `NoExplicitDefaultEntrypoint` is now GHC-understandable constraint,
      for previous behaviour with nice error message use
      `ForbidExplicitDefaultEntrypoint`.
    + `CanHaveEntrypoints` is made stricter, now it returns true only for
       Michelson sum types. If that's a problem for you, consider using
       `ShouldHaveEntrypoints` wrapper.
    + Added pseudo `Empty` type.
  * [!219](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/219)
    Various entrypoints-related updates.
    + Integrational tests now carry `TAddress` as a reference to contract.
      Make sure that parameters of the originated contracts are clear;
      e.g. origination of `consumer` contract may require explicit type
      annotation to specify parameter type.
      If you passed a reference to the originated contract to `View` constructor,
      consider using `mkView` instead or applying `callingDefTAddress` to the
      reference.
    + Generally it is encouraged to use `TAddress` instead of `Address`
      where it is used to refer to a contract.
    + `fromContractAddr` renamed to `fromContractRef`.
    + `Default` instances for `{Some,}EntrypointCall` are removed, use
       one of explicit versions: `epcPrimitive`, `epcCallRootUnsafe`.
    + Reworked `FutureContract` type.

  0.6.0
  =====

  * [!127](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/127)
    Limit annotations' allowed characters
  * [!184](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/184)
    Fix `LAMBDA` instruction type converter bug
  * [!173](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/173)
    [!197](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/197)
    Add support for lightweight entrypoints in Lorentz, as well as in
    the interpreter runner and morley executable.
    Support entrypoint references in `SELF` instruction.
    Minor refactorings related to entrypoints.
  * [!201](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/201)
    + Add entrypoint argument to methods in testing eDSL. Preserve the existing type of `lCall` and deprecate it.
    + Deprecate `Lorentz.TestScenario`.
  * [!208](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/208)
    Resolve an ambiguity within integrational and unit interpreters
    by renaming interpreter in `Michelson.Runtime` to `executor`.
  * [!180](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/180)
    Remove `coerce_` in favor of more safe variants.
    Migration guide: pick one of the functions from 'Lorentz.Coercions' module.
    In most cases you need one of the following ones:
      * `checkedCoerce_`
      * `coerceWrap` / `coerceUnwrap`
      * `forcedCoerce_` (aka old `coerce_` - this variant provides the least safety).
  * [!180](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/180)
    Type arguments of `coerceWrap` and `coerceUnwrap` are flipped.
    This change concerns you if you used type application on these functions.

  0.5.0
  =====

  * Require `morley-prelude` to be ≥ 0.3.0 to make Hackage happy.
  * [!156](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/156)
    Consider annotations in PACK and UNPACK.

  0.4.0
  =====

  * Implemented most of Babylon changes: new instructions, elimination of `big_map` restructions, new restrictions for the `contract` type, partial support for entrypoints. Some instructions have been removed/deprecated.
  * Many updates of helper data types for upgradeable contracts: `UParam` and `UStore`.
  * Michelson printer can produce pretty output, not just one line.
  * Added utilities for contract processing and analysis: optimizer, string transformer, errors transformer, analyzer.
  * Added `tasty` helpers to the testing engine.
  * Added annotations to typed representation and Lorentz.
  * Added automatic documentation generator.
  * Modified standard errors in Lorentz: now they are based on `CustomError`.
  * Added unpacking from readable representation.
  * Removed `parameter` and `storage` aliases, they were not very useful and complicated the code.
  * Extended cryptographic types and `Address` to work with other curves (tz2 and tz3 addresses).
  * Made it nearly impossible to generate dead code (which is illegal in Michelson) using Lorentz.
  * Various bug fixes.

  0.3.0.1
  =======

  * Update maintainer.

  0.3.0
  =====

  * [TM-68](https://issues.serokell.io/issue/TM-68) Lorentz DSL which allows one to write contracts directly in Haskell.
  May be moved to a separate package later.
  * [TM-132](https://issues.serokell.io/issue/TM-132) Names for contracts in integrational tests.
  * [TM-35](https://issues.serokell.io/issue/TM-35) `PACK` and `UNPACK` instructions.

  # Morley: Developer tools for the Michelson Language

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/morley.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley)

  Morley is a library to make writing smart contracts in Michelson pleasant and
  effective.

  ## I: A reimplementation of the Michelson Language in Haskell

  It consists of the following parts:

  - [`Tezos.*`](src/Tezos/) hierarchy is designed to implement cryptographic primitives, string and byte formats, and any other functionality specific to the Tezos protocol which is required for testing/execution of Michelson contracts but is used not only by Michelson.
  - [`Michelson.Untyped`](src/Michelson/Untyped.hs) and [`Michelson.Typed`](src/Michelson/Typed.hs) hierarchies define Haskell data types that assemble a Michelson contract. See [michelsonTypes.md](/docs/michelsonTypes.md).
  - [`Michelson.TypeCheck`](src/Michelson/TypeCheck.hs): A typechecker that validates Michelson contracts according to the Michelson's typing rules. Essentially, it performs conversion from untyped representation to the typed one. See [morleyTypechecker.md](/docs/morleyTypechecker.md).
  - [`Michelson.Interpret`](src/Michelson/Interpret.hs): An interpreter for Michelson contracts which doesn't perform any side effects. See [morleyInterpreter.md](/docs/morleyInterpreter.md).
  - [`Michelson.Macro`](src/Michelson/Macro.hs) Types for macros, syntactic sugar, and other extensions that are described in the next chapter.
  - [`Michelson.Parser`](src/Michelson/Parser.hs) A parser to turn a `.tz` or `.mtz` file (`.mtz` is a Michelson contract with Morley extensions) into a Haskell ADT.
  - [`Michelson.Runtime`](src/Michelson/Runtime.hs): A high-level interface to Morley functionality, see [morleyRuntime.md](/docs/morleyRuntime.md).

  ## II: Morley extensions

  One way to test Michelson contracts is to use the Morley language.
  It is a superset of the Michelson language, which means that each Michelson contract is also a valid Morley contract but not vice versa.
  There are several extensions which make it more convenient to write Michelson contracts and test them.
  For example, one can write inline assertions in their contracts for testing.
  All the details can be found in [the document](/docs/morleyLanguage.md) about these extensions.
  Also, there is a transpiler from Morley to Michelson.

  ## III: Morley-to-Michelson transpiler

  Morley-to-Michelson transpiler can be used to produce a Michelson contract from a Morley contract.
  You should use it if you want to develop contracts in Morley and submit them to the Tezos network.
  Workflow is the following:

  1. If your contract is called `foo.mtz`, use `morley print --contract foo.mtz --output foo.tz`. Note that normally you should not use `morley` directly, you should use `morley.sh` or `stack exec -- morley`. See usage instructions below.
  2. After that, you can use existing Tezos tools to deploy your contract. You can also typecheck or interpret it using a reference implementation. If you are not familiar with the Tezos tooling, please read [Tezos documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/index.html) or [Michelson tutorial](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/michelson-tutorial).

  ## Running and building

  Morley executable provides the following functionality:
  - `parse` contract and return its representation in Haskell types.
  - `typecheck` contract.
  - `run` contract. A given contract is being originated first, and then the transaction is being sent to it
  - `originate` contract.
  - `transfer` tokens to a given address.
  - `print` produce `.tz` contract that can be parsed by the OCaml referenced client from `.mtz` or `.tz` contract.

  You can get more info about this command by running `morley <command> --help`

  There are three ways to get Morley executable:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) based (preferable).
    * Get [script](/scripts/morley.sh)
   (e. g. using `curl https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/raw/master/scripts/morley.sh > morley.sh`)
    and run it `./morley.sh <args>`. This script will pull a docker image that contains the latest version of Morley executable from the master branch and run it with the given arguments.
      You'll need `coreutils` to be installed in order to use `morley.sh`.
    * Usage example:
      + `./morley.sh` to see help message
      + `./morley.sh run --contract add1.tz --storage 1 --parameter 1 --amount 1`
  - [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) based.
    * Clone this git repository and run `stack build` command,
      after that you can do `stack exec -- morley <args>` to run morley executable built from the source code.
    * Usage example:
      + `stack exec -- morley --help` to see help message
      + `stack exec -- morley originate --contract contracts/tezos_examples/attic/add1.tz --storage 1 --verbose`
  - [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) based.
    * Clone this git repository, go to this directory and run `cabal new-update && cabal new-build` command,
      after that you can do `cabal new-run -- morley <args>` to run morley executable built from the source code.
