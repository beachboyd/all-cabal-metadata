synopsis: Morpheus GraphQL
changelog: "## [0.6.0] - *.11.2019\n\n### Removed\n\n- removed `morpheus` cli for
  code generating, if you need cli you should use \n[morpheus-graphql-cli](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql-cli/)\n\n-
  example `API` executable is removed from Production build\n\n## Added\n\n- helper
  functions: `liftEitherM` , `liftM`\n\n  ```haskell\n    liftM :: m a -> Resolver
  o m e a\n    liftEitherM :: m (Either String a) -> Resolver o m e a\n  ```\n\n\n##
  [0.5.0] - 31.10.2019\n\n### Added\n\n- dummy support of `directives`, only parsing
  not actual implementation\n\n### Fixed\n\n- can be parsed `implements` with multiple
  interfaces separated by `&`\n- can be parsed default value on `inputobject`\n- Parser
  supports anonymous Operation: `query` , `mutation` , `subscription`\n  for example:\n\n
  \ ```\n  mutation {\n     name\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Morpheus client does not breaks
  on `Boolean` type, converts every GraphQL type `Boolean` to haskell `Bool` and GQL
  `String` to `Text`\n\n### Changed\n\n- Reduced `GQLRootResolver` signature :\n\n
  \ `GQLRootResolver IO () () Query () ()` -> `GQLRootResolver IO () Query () ()`\n\n
  \ `GQLRootResolver IO Channel Content Query Mutation Subscription` -> `GQLRootResolver
  IO APIEvent Query Mutation Subscription`\n\n  where `APIEvent = Event Channel Content`\n\n-
  `GQLRootResolver` automatically assigns corresponding monad to GraphQL Types.\n\n
  \ you can write just:\n\n  ```hs\n  GQLRootResolver IO APIEvent Query  Mutation
  Subscription\n  ```\n\n  instead of:\n\n  ```hs\n  GQLRootResolver IO APIEvent (Query
  (Resolver IO))  (Mutation (MutResolver IO ApiEvent) (Subscription (SubResolver IO
  ApiEvent))\n  ```\n\n  where operations are generated by `importGQLDocument` or
  have form :\n\n  ```\n  data Query m = Query {\n    field1 :: Args -> m Field1,\n
  \   ....\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `()` was replaced with `Undefined` in `GQLRootResolver`
  for empty operations `mutation`, `subscription`\n  ```\n  rootResolver :: GQLRootResolver
  IO () Query Undefined Undefined\n  ```\n- Root Operations `Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`
  are passed to root resolvers without boxing inside a monad.\n- there are only 3
  kind of resolvers `MutResolver`, `SubResolver` , `QueryResolver` defined by GADT
  `Resolver`\n\n## [0.4.0] - 09.10.2019\n\n## Changed\n\n- support of Default Value:\n\n
  \ - on query: Parsing Validating and resolving\n  - on Document: only Parsing\n\n-
  'lens' is removed from Library, client field collision can be handled with GraphQL
  `alias`:\n  ```gql\n  {\n    user {\n      name\n      friend {\n        friendName:
  name\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Fixed:\n\n- `Data.Morpheus.Document.toGraphQLDocument`
  generates only my user defined types. #259\n- Morpheus Client Namespaces Input Type
  Fields, they don't collide anymore:\n  example:\n  schema:\n\n  ```gql\n  input
  Person {\n    name: String!\n  }\n  ```\n\n  query:\n\n  ```gql\n  query GetUser
  (parent: Person!) {\n    ....\n  }\n  ```\n\n  wil generate:\n\n  ```hs\n  data
  GetUserArgs = GetUserArgs {\n    getUserArgsParent: Person\n  } deriving ...\n\n
  \ data Person = Person {\n    personName: Person\n  } deriving ...\n  ```\n\n- Morpheus
  Client Generated Output Object And Union Types don't collide:\n\n  ```gql\n  type
  Person {\n    name: String!\n    parent: Person!\n    friend: Person!\n  }\n  ```\n\n
  \ And we select\n\n  ```gql\n  {\n    user {\n      name\n      friend {\n        name\n
  \     }\n      parent {\n        name\n      }\n      bestFriend: friend {\n        name\n
  \       parent {\n          name\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  client
  will Generate:\n\n  - `UserPerson` from `{user`\n  - `UserFriendPerson`: from `{user{freind`\n
  \ - `UserParentPerson`: from `{user{parent`\n  - `UserBestFriendPerson`: from `{user{bestFrend`\n
  \ - `UserBestFriendParentPerson`: from `{user{bestFrend{parent`\n\n- GraphQL Client
  Defines enums and Input Types only once per query and they don't collide\n\n## [0.3.1]
  - 05.10.2019\n\n### Changed\n\n- removed dependencies: attoparsec , utf8-string\n-
  updated aeson lower bound up to: 1.4.4.0\n\n## [0.3.0] - 04.10.2019\n\n### Added\n\n-
  user can import GraphQL Document and generate types with it.\n\n  ```haskell\n    importGQLDocument
  \"API.gql\"\n  ```\n\n  this will generate types defined in `API.gql`\n\n### Fixed\n\n-
  `String` defined in GQLDcoument will be converted to `Text` by template haskell\n\n-
  `importGQLDocument` and `gqlDocument` supports Mutation, Subscription and Resolvers
  with custom Monad\n\n  for example. if we have:\n\n  ```gql\n  type Deity {\n    name:
  String!\n    power: Power!\n  }\n  ```\n\n  where `Power` is another object defined
  by gql schema.\n  template haskell will represent this type as:\n\n  ```haskell\n
  \    data Deity m = Deity {\n       name :: () -> m Text,\n       power :: () ->
  m (Power m)\n     }\n  ```\n\n  where `m` is resolver Monad.\n\n- `importGQLDocumentWithNamespace`
  generates namespaced haskell records. so that you have no more problem with name
  collision.\n  from this gql type:\n\n  ```gql\n  type Deity {\n    name: (id:Int)String!\n
  \   power: Power!\n  }\n  ```\n\n  will be generated.\n\n  ```haskell\n  data Deity
  m = Deity {\n    deityName :: DeityNameArgs -> m Text,\n    deityPower :: () ->
  m (Power m)\n  }\n\n  data DeityNameArgs = DeityNameArgs {\n    deityNameArgsId
  :: Int\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Changed\n\n- `GQLType` is mandatory for every GQL Type
  (including Query, Mutation and Subscription)\n- subscription Resolver changed\n\n
  \ from:\n\n  ```haskell\n    Subscription {newDeity = \\args -> Event {channels
  = [ChannelA], content = newDeityResolver } }\n  ```\n\n  to:\n\n  ```haskell\n    Subscription
  {newDeity = \\args -> SubResolver {subChannels = [ChannelA], subResolver = newDeityResolver
  } }\n  ```\n\n## [0.2.2] - 30.08.2019\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Parser Supports GraphQL
  multiline comments\n- Morpheus GraphQL Client: Support GraphQL Alias\n- Support
  of GraphQL Interfaces on GraphQL Document:\n\n  ```gql\n  # simple.gql\n  interface
  Node {\n    nodeId: ID!\n  }\n\n  type SimpleType implements Node {\n    nodeId:
  ID!\n    name: String!\n  }\n  ```\n\n  morpheus compiler will read interfaces and
  validate implements.\n  template haskell will generate haskell types only for types
  not for interfaces.\n\n  haskell type from `simple.gql`:\n\n  ```haskell\n   data
  SimpleType = SimpleType {\n      nodeId :: ID!\n      name   :: Text!\n    }  deriving
  (Generic)\n  ```\n\n  at the time compiler does not validates field Arguments by
  interface\n\n## [0.2.1] - 23.08.2019\n\n- assets are added to cabal source files\n\n##
  [0.2.0] - 23.08.2019\n\n### Added\n\n- Parser Supports GraphQL comments\n- Enhanced
  Subscription: mutation can trigger subscription with arguments\n- Experimental Support
  of Input Unions\n- GraphQL schema generating with: `Data.Morpheus.Document.toGraphQLDocument`\n-
  Generating dummy Morpheus Api from `schema.gql`:\n\n  ```\n  morpheus build schema/mythology.gql
  src/MythologyApi.hs\n  ```\n\n  [details](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql/issues/184)\n\n-
  `convertToJSONName` & `convertToHaskellName` has been extended to support all Haskell
  2010 reserved identities. [details](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql/issues/207)\n\n-
  `GraphQL Client` with Template haskell QuasiQuotes (Experimental, Not fully Implemented)\n\n
  \ ```haskell\n  defineQuery\n    [gql|\n      query GetHero ($byRealm: Realm)\n
  \       {\n          deity (realm:$byRealm) {\n            power\n            fullName\n
  \         }\n        }\n    |]\n  ```\n\n  will Generate:\n\n  - response type `GetHero`,
  `Deity` with `Lens` Instances\n  - input types: `GetHeroArgs` , `Realm`\n  - instance
  for `Fetch` typeClass\n\n  so that\n\n  ```haskell\n    fetchHero :: Args GetHero
  -> m (Either String GetHero)\n    fetchHero = fetch jsonRes args\n        where\n
  \         args = GetHeroArgs {byRealm = Just Realm {owner = \"Zeus\", surface =
  Just 10}}\n          jsonRes :: ByteString -> m ByteString\n          jsonRes =
  <fetch query from server>\n  ```\n\n  resolves well typed response `GetHero`.\n\n-
  Ability to define `GQLSchema` with GraphQL syntax ,\n  so that with this schema\n\n
  \ ```haskell\n\n  [gqlDocument|\n    type Query {\n      deity (uid: Text! ) : Deity!\n
  \   }\n\n    type Deity {\n      name  : Text!\n      power : Text\n    }\n  |]\n\n
  \ rootResolver :: GQLRootResolver IO () () Query () ()\n  rootResolver =\n    GQLRootResolver
  {queryResolver = return Query {deity}, mutationResolver = pure (), subscriptionResolver
  = pure ()}\n    where\n      deity DeityArgs {uid} = pure Deity {name, power}\n
  \       where\n          name _ = pure \"Morpheus\"\n          power _ = pure (Just
  \"Shapeshifting\")\n  ```\n\n  Template Haskell Generates types: `Query` , `Deity`,
  `DeityArgs`, that can be used by `rootResolver`\n\n  generated types are not compatible
  with `Mutation`, `Subscription`,\n  they can be used only in `Query`, but this issue
  will be fixed in next release\n\n### Fixed:\n\n- Parser supports enums inside input
  Object\n- fulfilled fragment Validation (added: unusedFragment,nameConflict)\n-
  correct decoding of Enums with more than 3 constructor #201\n\n### Changed\n\n-
  WebSocket subProtocol changed from `graphql-subscriptions` to `graphql-ws`\n\n-
  type familiy `KIND` is moved into typeClasses `GQLType`, so you should replace\n\n
  \ ```haskell\n  type instance KIND Deity = OBJECT\n\n  instance GQLType Deity where\n
  \   description  = const \"Custom Description for Client Defined User Type\"\n\n
  \ data Deity = Deity { fullName :: Text } deriving (Generic)\n  ```\n\n  with\n\n
  \ ```haskell\n  instance GQLType Deity where\n  type KIND Deity = OBJECT\n  description
  = const \"Custom Description for Client Defined User Type\"\n\n  data Deity = Deity
  { fullName :: Text } deriving (Generic)\n  ```\n\n- Duplicated variable names in
  Http requests are validated using `Aeson`'s `jsonNoDup` function. So the following
  request will\n  result in a parsing error\n\n  ```\n  {\"query\":\"...\",\n  \"variables\":{\"email\":\"foo@mail.net\",
  \"email\":\"bar@mail.net\",...}}\n  ```\n\n## [0.1.1] - 1.07.2019\n\n### Fixed:\n\n-
  () as Subscription or Mutation does not defines Operator without fields\n\n## [0.1.0]
  - 30.06.2019\n\nthanks for contributing to: @krisajenkins, @hovind, @vmchale, @msvbg\n\n###
  Added\n\n- support for Union Types: `type instance KIND <type> = UNION`\n- support
  of haskell Types: `Map`, `Set`, and Pair `(a,b)`\n- GraphQL Resolver supports custom
  Monad\n- add `Interpreter` class with instances:\n\n  - `ByteString -> m ByteString`
  and Lazy `ByteString`, where `m` is resolver monad\n  - `Text -> m Text` and Lazy
  `Text`, where `m` is resolver monad\n  - `GQLRequest -> m GQLResponse` , When you
  using it inside another Component that have Manual `ToJSON` deriving,\n    you have
  to ensure that `GQLResponse` will be encoded with `toEncoding`, and not with `toJSON`.\n\n-
  Schema Validation:\n\n  - Name Collision\n\n- support of Parsing input values: `Objects`,`Arrays`\n-
  support scalar type: `ID`\n- scalar Types are validated by `GQLScalar` instance

  \ - `ENUM`\n  - `INPUT_OBJECT`\n  - `UNION`\n\n- inline Fragments\n- GraphQL [Aliases](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases)\n-
  Subscriptions: `GQLSubscription`\n\n  - `a -> EffectM b` operation: is resolver
  that contains side effect in `EffectM`.\n    is used for Mutation and Subscribe
  communication\n  - `gqlEffectResolver [\"CHANNEL_ID\"]`: packs as effect Resolver.\n
  \   if mutation and subscription resolver have same channel then\n    every call
  of mutation will trigger subscription resolver\n  - `GQLState`: shared state between
  `http` and `websocket` server\n  - `gqlSocketApp` :converts `interpreter` to `websocket`
  application\n  - `graphql-subscriptions`: `Apollo GraphQL` subProtocol\n\n- language:\n
  \ - Query supports : `__type(name:\"type\")`\n  - On every Object can be selected
  : `__typename`\n\n### Changed\n\n- `GQLRootResolver`, `GQLType(..)` , `GQLScalar(..)`\n
  \ are moved in `Data.Morpheus.Types`\n- `GQLRoot { query, mutation, subscription
  }` to `GQLRootResolver {queryResolver, mutationResolver, subscriptionResolver}`\n-
  `interpreter`: can be used in `http` and `websocket` server\n- `GQLKind` renamed
  as `GQLType`\n- types can be derived just with `(Generic,GQLType)`\n- haskell record
  field `type'` will generate GQL Object field `type`\n- public API (all other modules
  are hidden):\n  - Data.Morpheus\n  - Data.Morpheus.Kind\n  - Data.Morpheus.Types\n
  \ - Data.Morpheus.Execution.Subscription\n\n### Fixed:\n\n- parser can read fields
  with digits like: a1 , \\_1\n- you can use Wrapped type and Wrapped Primitive Types
  issue #136:\n  - wrapped TypesNames will be separated with \"\\_\" : typeName(Either
  A B) -> \"Either_A_B\"\n- introspection:\n  - argument supports `Non-Null` and `List`\n
  \ - every field has correct kind\n\n### Removed\n\n- `GQLArgs`: you can derive arguments
  just with `Generic` without `GQLArgs`\n- `GQLObject`: replaced with instance `type
  instance KIND <Type> = OBJECT`\n- `GQLEnum`: replaced with instance `type instance
  KIND <Type> = ENUM`\n- `GQLInput`: replaced with instance `type instance KIND <Type>
  = INPUT_OBJECT`\n- `Typeable` : with new deriving it is not required anymore\n-
  `Wrapper`: with TypeFamilies there is no need for `Wrapper`\n- `a ::-> b` is Replaced
  by `a -> ResM b` where `ResM` is alias for `Resolver IO a`\n- `GQLMutation` , `GQLQuery`
  : with new deriving it is not required anymore\n- `Resolver` constructor replaced
  by functions:\n  - `gqlResolver` : packs `m Either String a` to `Resolver m a`\n
  \ - `gqlEffectResolver`: resolver constructor for effectedResolver\n  - `liftEffectResolver`:

  # Morpheus GraphQL [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/morpheus-graphql.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/morpheus-graphql) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql)

  Build GraphQL APIs with your favourite functional language!

  Morpheus GraphQL (Server & Client) helps you to build GraphQL APIs in Haskell with native haskell types.
  Morpheus will convert your haskell types to a GraphQL schema and all your resolvers are just native Haskell functions. Mopheus GraphQL can also convert your GraphQL Schema or Query to Haskell types and validate them in compile time.

  Morpheus is still in an early stage of development, so any feedback is more than welcome, and we appreciate any contribution!
  Just open an issue here on GitHub, or join [our Slack channel](https://morpheus-graphql-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) to get in touch.

  ## Getting Started

  ### Setup

  To get started with Morpheus, you first need to add it to your project's dependencies, as follows (assuming you're using hpack):

  _package.yml_

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    - morpheus-graphql
  ```

  Additionally, you should tell stack which version to pick:

  _stack.yml_

  ```yaml
  resolver: lts-14.8

  extra-deps:
    - morpheus-graphql-0.6.0
  ```

  As Morpheus is quite new, make sure stack can find morpheus-graphql by running `stack upgrade` and `stack update`

  ### Building your first GraphQL API

  ### with GraphQL syntax

  _schema.gql_

  ```gql
  type Query {
    deity(name: String!): Deity!
  }

  type Deity {
    name: String!
    power: String
  }
  ```

  _API.hs_

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric         #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts      #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances     #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE NamedFieldPuns        #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings     #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables   #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell       #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies          #-}

  module API (api) where

  import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as B

  import           Data.Morpheus              (interpreter)
  import           Data.Morpheus.Document     (importGQLDocumentWithNamespace)
  import           Data.Morpheus.Types        (GQLRootResolver (..), IORes)
  import           Data.Text                  (Text)

  importGQLDocumentWithNamespace "schema.gql"

  rootResolver :: GQLRootResolver IO () Query Undefined Undefined
  rootResolver =
    GQLRootResolver
      {
        queryResolver = Query {queryDeity},
        mutationResolver = Undefined,
        subscriptionResolver = Undefined
      }
    where
      queryDeity QueryDeityArgs {queryDeityArgsName} = pure Deity {deityName, deityPower}
        where
          deityName _ = pure "Morpheus"
          deityPower _ = pure (Just "Shapeshifting")

  api :: ByteString -> IO ByteString
  api = interpreter rootResolver
  ```

  Template Haskell Generates types: `Query` , `Deity`, `DeityArgs`, that can be used by `rootResolver`

  `importGQLDocumentWithNamespace` will generate Types with namespaced fields. if you don't need napespacing use `importGQLDocument`

  ### with Native Haskell Types

  To define a GraphQL API with Morpheus we start by defining the API Schema as a native Haskell data type,
  which derives the `Generic` typeclass. Lazily resolvable fields on this `Query` type are defined via `a -> IORes b`, representing resolving a set of arguments `a` to a concrete value `b`.

  ```haskell
  data Query m = Query
    { deity :: DeityArgs -> m Deity
    } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

  data Deity = Deity
    { fullName :: Text         -- Non-Nullable Field
    , power    :: Maybe Text   -- Nullable Field
    } deriving (Generic)

  instance GQLType Deity where
    type  KIND Deity = OBJECT

  data DeityArgs = DeityArgs
    { name      :: Text        -- Required Argument
    , mythology :: Maybe Text  -- Optional Argument
    } deriving (Generic)
  ```

  For each field in the `Query` type defined via `a -> m b` (like `deity`) we will define a resolver implementation that provides the values during runtime by referring to
  some data source, e.g. a database or another API. Fields that are defined without `a -> m b` you can just provide a value.

  In above example, the field of `DeityArgs` could also be named using reserved identities (such as: `type`, `where`, etc), in order to avoid conflict, a prime symbol (`'`) must be attached. For example, you can have:

  ```haskell
  data DeityArgs = DeityArgs
    { name      :: Text        -- Required Argument
    , mythology :: Maybe Text  -- Optional Argument
    , type'     :: Text
    } deriving (Generic)
  ```

  The field name in the final request will be `type` instead of `type'`. The Morpheus request parser converts each of the reserved identities in Haskell 2010 to their corresponding names internally. This also applies to selections.

  ```haskell
  resolveDeity :: DeityArgs -> IORes e Deity
  resolveDeity DeityArgs { name, mythology } = liftEitherM $ dbDeity name mythology

  askDB :: Text -> Maybe Text -> IO (Either String Deity)
  askDB = ...
  ```

  Note that the type `a -> IORes b` is just Synonym for `a -> ExceptT String IO b`

  To make this `Query` type available as an API, we define a `GQLRootResolver` and feed it to the Morpheus `interpreter`. A `GQLRootResolver` consists of `query`, `mutation` and `subscription` definitions, while we omit the latter for this example:

  ```haskell
  rootResolver :: GQLRootResolver IO () Query Undefined Undefined
  rootResolver =
    GQLRootResolver
      { queryResolver = Query {deity = resolveDeity}
      , mutationResolver = Undefined
      , subscriptionResolver = Undefined
      }

  gqlApi :: ByteString -> IO ByteString
  gqlApi = interpreter rootResolver
  ```

  As you can see, the API is defined as `ByteString -> IO ByteString` which we can either invoke directly or use inside an arbitrary web framework
  such as `scotty` or `serverless-haskell`. We'll go for `scotty` in this example:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = scotty 3000 $ post "/api" $ raw =<< (liftIO . gqlApi =<< body)
  ```

  If we now send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api` with a GraphQL Query as body for example in a tool like `Insomnia`:

  ```GraphQL
  query GetDeity {
    deity (name: "Morpheus") {
      fullName
      power
    }
  }
  ```

  our query will be resolved!

  ```JSON
  {
    "data": {
      "deity": {
        "fullName": "Morpheus",
        "power": "Shapeshifting"
      }
    }
  }

  ## Serverless Example

  If you are interested in creating a `Morpheus GraphQL` API with `Serverless`, you should take a look at our example in this repository:
  [_Mythology API_](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/mythology-api) it is our example project build with `Morpheus GraphQL` and `Serverless-Haskell`,
  where you can query different mythology characters with `GraphiQL`.

  Mythology API is deployed on : [_api.morpheusgraphql.com_](https://api.morpheusgraphql.com) where you can test it with `GraphiQL`

  ## Advanced topics

  ### Enums

  You can use Union Types as Enums, but they're not allowed to have any parameters.

  ```haskell
  data City
    = Athens
    | Sparta
    | Corinth
    | Delphi
    | Argos
    deriving (Generic)

  instance GQLType City where
    type KIND City = ENUM
  ```

  ### Union types

  To use union type, all you have to do is derive the `GQLType` class. Using GraphQL [_fragments_](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments), the arguments of each data constructor can be accessed from the GraphQL client.

  ```haskell
  data Character
    = DEITY Deity
    | HUMAN Human
    deriving (Generic)

  instance GQLType Character where
    type KIND City = UNION
  ```

  ### Scalar types

  To use custom scalar types, you need to provide implementations for `parseValue` and `serialize` respectively.

  ```haskell
  data Odd = Odd Int  deriving (Generic)

  instance GQLScalar Odd where
    parseValue (Int x) = pure $ Odd (...  )
    parseValue (String x) = pure $ Odd (...  )
    serialize  (Odd value) = Int value

  instance GQLType Odd where
    type KIND Odd = SCALAR
  ```

  ### Applicative and Monad instance

  The `Resolver` type has `Applicative` and `Monad` instances that can be used to compose resolvers.

  ### Introspection

  Morpheus converts your schema to a GraphQL introspection automatically. You can use tools like `Insomnia` to take a
  look at the introspection and validate your schema.
  If you need a description for your GQLType inside of the introspection you can define the GQLType instance manually
  and provide an implementation for the `description` function:

  ```haskell
  data Deity = Deity
  { ...
  } deriving (Generic)

  instance GQLType Deity where
    description = const "A supernatural being considered divine and sacred"
  ```

  ### Mutations

  In addition to queries, Morpheus also supports mutations. The behave just like regular queries and are defined similarly:
  Just exchange deriving `GQLQuery` for `GQLMutation` and declare them separately at the `GQLRootResolver` definition

  ```haskell
  newtype Mutation m = Mutation
    { createDeity :: Form -> m Deity
    } deriving (Generic, GQLType)

  createDeityMutation :: Form -> m (Deity m)
  createDeityMutation = ...

  rootResolver :: GQLRootResolver IO Query Mutation Undefined
  rootResolver =
    GQLRootResolver
      { queryResolver = Query {...}
      , mutationResolver = Mutation {
         createDeity = createDeityMutation
      }
      , subscriptionResolver = Undefined
      }

  gqlApi :: ByteString -> IO ByteString
  gqlApi = interpreter rootResolver
  ```

  ### Subscriptions

  im morpheus subscription and mutation communicating with Events,
  `Event` consists with user defined `Channel` and `Content`.

  every subscription has own Channel by which will be triggered

  ```haskell
  data Channel
    = ChannelA
    | ChannelB

  data Content
    = ContentA Int
    | ContentB Text

  newtype Query m = Query
    { deity :: () -> m Deity
    } deriving (Generic)

  newtype Mutation m = Mutation
    { createDeity :: () -> m Deity
    } deriving (Generic)

  newtype Subscription m = Subscription
    { newDeity :: () -> m  Deity
    } deriving (Generic)

  type APIEvent = Event Channel Content

  rootResolver :: GQLRootResolver IO APIEvent Query Mutation Subscription
  rootResolver =
    GQLRootResolver
      { queryResolver = Query {deity = const fetchDeity}
      , mutationResolver = Mutation {createDeity}
      , subscriptionResolver = Subscription {newDeity}
      }
    where
      createDeity _args = MutResolver events updateDeity
          where
          events = [Event {channels = [ChannelA], content = ContentA 1}]
          updateDeity = updateDBDeity
      newDeity _args = SubResolver [ChannelA] subResolver
        where
          subResolver (Event [ChannelA] (ContentA _value)) = fetchDeity  -- resolve New State
          subResolver (Event [ChannelA] (ContentB _value)) = fetchDeity   -- resolve New State
          subResolver _                                    = fetchDeity -- Resolve Old State
  ```

  ## Morpheus `GraphQL Client` with Template haskell QuasiQuotes

  ```hs
  defineByDocumentFile
      "./schema.gql"
    [gql|
      query GetHero ($character: Character)
        {
          deity (fatherOf:$character) {
            name
            power
            worships {
              deity2Name: name
            }
          }
        }
    |]
  ```

  with schema:

  ```gql
  input Character {
    name: String!
  }

  type Deity {
    name: String!
    worships: Deity
  }
  ```

  will validate query and Generate:

  - namespaced response and variable types
  - instance for `Fetch` typeClass

  ```hs
  data GetHero = GetHero {
    deity: DeityDeity
  }

  -- from: {user
  data DeityDeity = DeityDeity {
    name: Text,
    worships: Maybe DeityWorshipsDeity
  }

  -- from: {deity{worships
  data DeityWorshipsDeity = DeityWorshipsDeity {
    name: Text,
  }

  data GetHeroArgs = GetHeroArgs {
    getHeroArgsCharacter: Character
  }

  data Character = Character {
    characterName: Person
  }
  ```

  as you see, response type field name collision can be handled with GraphQL `alias`.

  with `fetch` you can fetch well typed response `GetHero`.

  ```haskell
    fetchHero :: Args GetHero -> m (Either String GetHero)
    fetchHero = fetch jsonRes args
        where
          args = GetHeroArgs {getHeroArgsCharacter = Person {characterName = "Zeus"}}
          jsonRes :: ByteString -> m ByteString
          jsonRes = <GraphQL APi>
  ```

  types can be generatet from `introspection` too:

  ```haskell
  defineByIntrospectionFile "./introspection.json"
  ```

  ## Morpheus CLI for Code Generating

  you should use [morpheus-graphql-cli](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql-cli)

  # About

  ## The name

  _Morpheus_ is the greek god of sleep and dreams whose name comes from the greek word _μορφή_ meaning form or shape.
  He is said to be able to mimic different forms and GraphQL is good at doing exactly that: Transforming data in the shape
  of many different APIs.

  ## Team

  Morpheus is written and maintained by [_nalchevanidze_](https://github.com/nalchevanidze)

  ## Roadmap

  - Medium future:
    - Stabilize API
    - Specification-isomorphic error handling
  - Long term:
    - Support all possible GQL features
    - Performance optimization
