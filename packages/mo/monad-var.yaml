description: ! '# monad-var


  The aim of this library is to provide a unified set of operations (`new`, `read`,
  `write`, `swap`, various strict `mutate*` functions and their derivatives (like
  mutate-and-return-the-old-value) and a certain interface for `MVar`-like things)
  over all common variable types: `IORef`, `STRef s`, `MVar`, `TVar`, `TMVar`.

  When possible type classes are generalized to be over abstract containers rather
  than variables: e.g. it''d make sense to implement `MonadRead TChan` and `MonadMutate_
  Vector` instances, but no such instances are provided right now.

  There are also some lenses to be described in an upcoming blog post.
