  A monad to support computations which consume values from a (possibly infinite)
  supply.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nPlease let me know if there is any issue with the licensing
  or copyright â€” I am assuming that, because the code appears on the HaskellWiki pages,
  it follows the [Simple license](https://wiki.haskell.org/HaskellWiki:Copyrights)
  found there, and that packaging it in this way is not a problem.\n\n## About this
  library\n\nI pulled this more or less verbatim from the HaskellWiki, since I wanted
  it on \nHackage for distribution purposes:\n\n  http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/New_monads/MonadSupply\n\nSome
  stuff was added, like a monoid instance and various helper functions.\n\n    This
  library is based on code found on the HaskellWiki, and subject to the\n    license
  found there:\n\n      http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellWiki:Copyrights\n\n
