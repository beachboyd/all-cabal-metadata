  Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mrkkrp/modern-uri/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/mrkkrp/modern-uri?branch=master)\n\nThis
  is a modern library for working with URIs in Haskell as per RFC 3986:\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986\n\n##
  Motivation\n\nThere are already at least two libraries for working with URIs:\n[`uri`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uri)
  and\n[`uri-bytestring`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uri-bytestring). Why\nwrite
  one more?\n\nLet's see first about the `uri` package:\n\n* It uses `String` instead
  of `Text` or `ByteString`, it is thus\n  inefficient.\n* The types are not very
  precise. Query string is represented as `Maybe\n  String` for example.\n* Uses Parsec
  under the hood, however does not allow us to use its URI\n  parser in a bigger Parsec
  parser.\n\nNow what about `uri-bytestring`?\n\n* Works with `ByteString`, which
  totally makes sense because a URI can have\n  only ASCII characters in it. However
  sometimes a URI is a part of a bigger\n  document that can contain Unicode characters
  and so we may need to parse a\n  URI from `Text` or render it to `Text`. Ideally,
  we would like to be able\n  to parse from both `Text` and `ByteString` as well to
  render to both\n  `Text` and `ByteString`.\n* Does not allow to use its URI parser
  as part of a bigger parser.\n* Provides `newtype` wrappers for different components
  of URI, but we could\n  still put something incorrect inside.\n* Absolute and relative
  URI references have different types, which may or\n  may not be handy.\n* Provides
  lenses, but does not provide e.g. traversal for working with\n  query parameters
  selected by their names.\n\n## Features\n\nThe `modern-uri` package features:\n\n*
  Correct by construction `URI` data type. Correctness is ensured by\n  guaranteeing
  that every sub-component of the `URI` record is by itself\n  cannot be invalid.
  This boils down to careful use of types and a set of\n  smart constructors for things
  like scheme, host, etc.\n* Absolute and relative URIs differ only by the scheme
  component: if it's\n  `Nothing`, then URI is relative, otherwise it's absolute.\n*
  Megaparsec parser that can be used as a standalone smart constructor for\n  the
  `URI` data type (see `mkURI`) as well as be seamlessly integrated into\n  a bigger
  Megaparsec parser.\n* Fast rendering to strict `Text` and `ByteString` as well as
  to their\n  respective `Builder` types.\n* Extensive set of lensy helpers for easier
  manipulation of the nested data\n  types (see `Text.URI.Lens`).\n* Quasi-quoters
  for compile-time construction of the `URI` data type and\n  refined text types (see
  `Text.URI.QQ`).\n\nTODO:\n\n* Provide parser that can parse URIs from `ByteString`s.\n\n##
