description: ! '# bv-sized


  This library defines a BitVector datatype that is parameterized by the vector

  width.


  It is especially useful in applications where the length of every individual bit

  vector will be known at compile time. Supports width-changing operations like

  truncation, signed/unsigned extension, and extraction/bit slicing.
