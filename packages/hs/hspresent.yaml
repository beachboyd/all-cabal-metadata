description: ! "Presenting hspresent\n====================\n\nThis is a simple program
  that lets you give powerpoint-like presentations in\nyour terminal (for certain
  definitions of powerpoint-like). It's extremely basic\nand unintelligent. Don't
  expect much.\n\nCompile and install using cabal:\n    cabal build && cabal install\n\nThis
  will compile hspresent, and install an `hspresent` command line program.\n\nYou
  can download the latest stable release of hspresent on\n[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspresent).
  The git repository is\nonline at `git://github.com/eklitzke/hspresent.git`.\n\nUsage\n-----\nInvoke
  like `hspresent /path/to/your/presentation`. Left and right arrow keys\nmove between
  slides, and hitting `q` or `Ctrl-C` quits the presentation.\n\nThe file format is
  really simple right now. Slides are separated by lines\nconsisting of the characters
  `--`. You can put the single character `.` on a\nline to demarcate a \"split\" frame.
  A split frame really creates a new frame with\nthe contents of the previous frame
  copied at the front (this is similar to how\nbeamer works). That's it. Here's an
  example presentation:\n    the title of the first slide\n    this is\n    .\n    really
  cool\n    --\n    the title of the second slide\n    hooray for hspresent\n    --\n
  \   look at how fancy the title to this slide is\n    * bullet point one\n    *
  bullet point two\n"
