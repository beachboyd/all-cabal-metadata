  if setDebugLogLevel called before other functions.\n  * Fixed GHCi cbits library
  install location.\n  * Changed Setup script to use Cabal 2 API only.\n  * Relaxed
  Cabal constraint on 'QuickCheck'.\n\nrelease-0.3.5.0 - 2017.09.08\n\n  * Added facility
  for setting Qt application flags.\n  * Fixed building GHCi objects with Cabal 1.24.\n
  \ * Relaxed Cabal constraint on 'QuickCheck' and fixed test suite.\n  * Relaxed
  Cabal constraint on 'directory'.\n\nrelease-0.3.4.1 - 2016.07.21\n\n  * Added support
  for Cabal 1.24 API.\n  * Fixed linking shared builds against MacOS frameworks (needs

  through command line arguments by default.\n  * Fixed class at same address as deleted
  class causing inaccessible objects.\n  * Fixed memory corruption bug prior to Qt
  5.2 with workaround.\n  * Fixed building with Fedora-style moc executable names
  (non-qtselect).\n  * Fixed building GHCi objects with GHC 7.10.\n  * Fixed missing

  objects in QML variants.\n  * Fixed corrupted logging output caused by threading.\n\nrelease-0.3.1.0
