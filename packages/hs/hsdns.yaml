description: |-
  This library provides an asynchronous DNS resolver on top
  of GNU ADNS <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/>.
  Not all options are supported, but A, MX, and PTR lookups
  work nicely. There is also support for retrieving generic
  RR types, CNAMEs, and for NSEC zone walking. The library
  can be expected to work with fine ADNS 1.4 or later. It
  might also work with version ADNS 1.3, but that hasn't
  been tested.

  The example program adns-reverse-lookup.hs demonstrates
  how the resolver is used. Given a list of host names on
  the command line, it performs an A/PTR double-lookup and
  checks whether the records are consistent. The
  output is printed in the order in which the DNS responses
  arrive:

  > $ ./adns-reverse-lookup cryp.to localhost www.example.com
  > OK: localhost <-> 127.0.0.1
  > FAIL: cryp.to -> 217.19.183.102 -> ["zuse.cryp.to"]
  > OK: www.example.com <-> 192.0.32.10
