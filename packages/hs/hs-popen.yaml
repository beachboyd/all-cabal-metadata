description: ! '* Description

  This is a tiny set of _portable_ bindings to ~popen~, ~pclose~, and ~fileno~.

  This project exists because I was trying to bind to C functions that read/write

  streams and require a raw file descriptors and nothing I found on Hackage or in

  ~base~ allowed me to work with raw file descriptors portably across Posix and

  Windows.


  The ~base~ libraries do provide portable ~Handle~''s which work well if all

  stream processing is done within Haskell. However it turned out to be quite

  difficult to portably get and set a raw file descriptor from a ~Handle~.

  ~System.Posix~ does provide this functionality but it does not work on Windows.

  * Installation

  Simply doing ~stack install~ should work.

  * Demo

  To help you get started this project ships with an executable ~ls-example~

  which simply lists the files in the current directory.
