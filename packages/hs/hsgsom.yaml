description: ! "= README\n\nThis is the README file of hsgsom, a haskell library implementing
  the\ngrowing self organising map clustering algorithm.\n\n== The Algorithm\n\nThe
  growing self organising map (GSOM) algorithm is a clustering algorithm\nworking
  on a set of n-dimensional numeric input vectors. It's output is a\nnetwork of nodes
  laid out in two dimensions where each node has a weight\nvector associated with
  it. This weight vector has the same dimension as the\ninput vectors and is meant
  to be intepreted as a cluster center, i.e. it\nrepresents those input vectors whose
  distance to the node's weight vector\nis minimal when compared to the distance to
  the other nodes weight vectors.\nSee <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSOM> for an
  explanation of the algorithm.\nThe algorithm was introduced in:\n\n  Alahakoon,
  D., Halgamuge, S. K. and Sirinivasan, B. (2000)\n  Dynamic Self Organizing Maps
  With Controlled Growth\n  for Knowledge Discovery,\n  IEEE Transactions on Neural
  Networks,\n  Special Issue on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 11, pp 601-614.\n\n==
  License\n\nThis package and its contents are licensed under the BSD 3 clause license.\nYou
  should have received a file called LICENSE containing said license\nalong with this
  package.\n\n== Versioning\n\nThis README correponds to version 0.1.0 of hsgsom,
  so as you can see it is\na very early version.\nVersion numbers follow the pattern
  X.Y.Z and have the following meaning:\n\n  - a change in Z corresponds to minor
  changes as in documentation changes\n    or changes to the underlying implementation\n\n
  \ - a change in Y correponds to added functionality and/or backwards\n    compatible
  interface changes/additions.\n\n  - a change in X correpsonds to a major implementation
  change either\n    drastically changing the algorithm behaviour or performance or\n
  \   changing the interface in a possibly not backwards compatible way.\n\n== Questions,
  Bugs, etc...\n\nIf you think you have found a bug, or you have questions or suggestions\nor
  really anything to say about the package it would be greatly appreciated\nif you
  would drop me a note or an email.\nThis is my very firt attempt at packaging and
  releasing a substantial amount\nmy own code to the public and I'm eager to learn
  how to do thinks better.\n\nThanks for using/looking at this package and have a
  nice day.\n"
