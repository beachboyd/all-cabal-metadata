description: ! 'Haskell FFI Binding Modules Generator (HSFFIG) is a tool that parses

  C library include files (.h) and generates Haskell Foreign Functions Interface

  import declarations for all functions, #define''d constants (where possible),

  enumerations, and structures/unions (to access their members).

  It is assumed that the GNU C Compiler and Preprocessor are used.

  Auto-generated Haskell modules may be imported into an application

  to get access to the foreign library''s functions and variables.


  The package provides a small library that programs using auto-generated

  imports have to link to (specify HSFFIG as one of build-depends), and two

  executable programs:


  * hsffig: a filter program reading pre-processed include files

  from standard input, and producing one large .hsc file to be processed

  by @hsc2hs@, and possibly cut into pieces by @modsplit@. See

  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HSFFIG/Tutorial> for more information.


  * ffipkg: a wrapper over @hsffig@ which automates the process of

  building a Cabal package out of C include files provided by running

  the preprocessor, @hsffig@, the splitter, and preparing the files

  necessary to build a package. See

  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FFI_imports_packaging_utility> for

  more information.


  Please note that @hsffig@ and @ffipkg@ will likely not work properly

  with C++ include files.'
