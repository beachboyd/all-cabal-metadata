description: ! "HSNTP - Haskell Simple Network Time Protocol\n\nSimple Network Time
  Protocol is a simple subset of NTP. This package\nincludes Haskell libraries to
  use SNTP Protocol and small client and\nserver implementations. The package contains
  everything needed for a compilation.\n\nCompiling and installation\n\n   Download
  and unpack.\n   Build and install through Cabal as for other Haskell packages:\n\n
  \       runhaskell Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME\n        runhaskell Setup
  build\n        runhaskell Setup install --user\n\n  (You may want to remove the
  --user flag when installing as root.)\n\n\nDependencies\n\nThe library depends on
  GHC, but porting should not be too hard as the\ncode is quite short.\n\n\nsntpdate
  server\n\nSntpdate fetches the date from an (s)ntp-server and tries\nto set the
  local clock.\n\n\nsntpd\n\nSntpd serves the local clock to interested (s)ntp clients.\nThe
  program forks into the background. Needs a wrapper\nfor non-root operation as ntp
  runs in a privileged port."
