synopsis: A preprocessor that helps with writing Haskell bindings to C code
changelog: ! "## 0.68.2\n\n - Support GHC 8.2.1\n\n - Make `hsc_alignment` macro work
  in clang\n   ([D3346](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D3346))\n\n - Track column
  numbers to improve GHC's caret diagnostic display\n   ([#13388](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/13388))\n\n##
  0.68.1\n\n - Fix type signature of generated `main` test function\n   to avoid C
  compiler warnings about unused `argc`/`argv`\n   function parameters during feature
  testing.\n\n - Double-escape paths used to build call to `hsc_line`\n   ([#12504](http://ghc.haskell.org/ticket/12504))\n"

description: ! 'The hsc2hs program can be used to automate some parts of the

  process of writing Haskell bindings to C code.  It reads an

  almost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and

  outputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based

  on information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs

  provide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,

  including sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.
