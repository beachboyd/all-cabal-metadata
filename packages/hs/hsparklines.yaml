description: ! "\nINTRO\n\nSparklines are high content to size ratio minigraphs inspired
  by Edward Tufte.\n\nThe focus of a sparkline is to provide additional context inline
  with text\nso users can do more informed analysis and make better decisions.  To
  make\nthem fit with inline text, sparklines are generally small (100px x 30px)\nand
  dispense with axis labels and units.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\no http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR&topic_id=1\no
