  # hs-speedscope

  `hs-speedscope` is a simple executable for converting an eventlog into a format suitable to load into [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/).

  WARNING: Only GHC 8.10 supports generating an eventlog with the correct events for this program to work.

  ## Usage

  1. Create an eventlog which contains time profiling events by running your program with `program +RTS -p -l-au`.
  2. Run `hs-speedscope` on the resulting eventlog `hs-speedscope program.eventlog`.
  3. Load the resulting `program.eventlog.json` file into [speedscope](https://speedscope.app) to visualise the profile.

  ## Filtering an eventlog

  It is sometimes useful to isolate a specific part of the sample, for example, when
  I was profiling ghcide, I want to isolate a single hover request.

  The `--start` and `--end` options can be used to indicate which parts of the
  eventlog to keep. The filtering options look for messages inserted into the
  eventlog by [`traceMarker`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Debug-Trace.html#v:traceMarker) events.

  * No events before the first marker which matches the prefix given by `--start`
  will be included in the result
  * No events after the first marker which matches the prefix given by `--end` will
  be included in the result.

  For example, the following invocation will filter the profile between the START and END markers.

  ```
  hs-speedscope File.eventlog --start START --end END
  ```
