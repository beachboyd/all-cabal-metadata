description: ! "                 hspread : a client library for spread\n\n    hspread
  is a client library for the Spread toolkit[1].\n    It is fully implemented in haskell
  and supports the most recent version\n    of the protocol. Its aim is to make easier
  to implement correct distribuited\n    applications by taking advantage of the guarantees
  granted by Spread:\n    such as reliable and total ordered messages. It's intended
  to be used\n    with a serialization library like binary[2], and a separate installation\n
  \   of the spread deamon.\n\nInstalling:\n\n  It installs like every other cabal
  package:\n      runhaskell Setup configure  -- this can fail with missing dependecies\n
  \     runhaskell Setup build\n      runhaskell Setup install    -- you may need
  superuser privileges here\n\n  Haddock documentation can be generated with:\n     runhaskell
  Setup haddock\n\n  You can then test it with the spflooder clone under examples/,\n
  \ not forgetting to have a spread deamon running.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe
  development version is kept in a darcs repository here:\n\n  darcs get http://happs.org/repos/hspread\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1]
