description: ! 'Functions I found I was using repeatedly when doing shell programming
  with HSH.

  Rather than duplicate code, released on hackage.

  A lot of this is cruft. For instance, you are probably better off having a look
  at System.Posix.Files and

  System.Posix.Users, which I overlooked when writing, before making too much use
  of hsh helpers.'
