description: ! 'The supplied PreProcessor can be run over any existing source and
  would generate FFI code for every function marked to be exported by the special
  notation documented inside the package. It then proceeds to compile this generated
  code into a lib.


  The Library contains some helper code that''s commonly needed to convert between
  types, and contains the code for the typeclasses the PreProcessor uses in the generated
  code to keep things clean.


  It will always generated the required C types for use when calling the dll, but
  it will also generate the C# unsafe code if requested.


  Read http://www.scribd.com/doc/63918055/Hs2lib-Tutorial#scribd


  A replacement for this library is in development and will eventually replace this


  Current Restrictions:


  - Does NOT support x64 bit versions of GHC. This will be added in future versions
  if enough demand exist.


  - You cannot export functions which have the same name (even if they''re in different
  modules because 1 big hsc file is generated at the moment, no conflict resolutions)


  - You cannot export datatypes with the same name, same restriction as above.


  - Does not support automatic instance generation for infix constructors yet


  - List of Lists are not supported (concat them first).


  NOTE: Package is now working again, but I have fixed the version of haskell-src-exts
  to prevent it from breaking again.
