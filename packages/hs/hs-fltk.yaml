description: ! "Haskell interface to the FLTK window toolkit\n\n* Built using Cabal
  with hacks.\n* For more information about FLTK see www.fltk.org\n* Porting to windows
  should be possible, but I don't have the resources to do it.\n\nDependencies\n\n*
  A very recent version of Cabal is needed\n  * 17.11. support for C-Sources in subdirs\n
  \ *  6.12. Extra-Lib-Dirs support - not necessary on all platforms.\n* Works with
  both GHC 6.2 and the CVS version of GHC.\n* FLTK 1.1 headers and library\n* No direct
  dependency on libstdc++ although libfltk does depend on it.\n  This is to avoid
  issues with linkers doing nasty things.\n\nBuilding\n\n* Download and unpack.\n*
  Build and install through Cabal as for other Haskell packages:\n\n      runhaskell
  Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME\n      runhaskell Setup build\n      runhaskell
  Setup install --user\n\n(You may want to remove the --user flag when installing
  as root.)\n\n* see example/\n* library errors are most likely due to missing symlinks\n
  \ e.g. libfltk.so -> libfltk.so.1, if someone knows how to fix this\n  with Cabal
  please tell.\n\nTODO\n\n* GHCI support is broken due to GHC not supporting weak
  (W) symbols properly.\n* The Hugs Debian package is not usable.\n\nFor more information
