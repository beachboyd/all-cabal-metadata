description: ! 'A very basic LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov√°sz) lattice reduction algorithm
  in Haskell.


  * As of now, it seems to work on 2 small test cases and on some larger ones. I need
  to generate tests for it, for example comparing it to NTL''s LLL output

  * There are *no* optimizations implemented yet

  * The interface is currently not well-designed, it should of course take at least
  Integer instead of Rational

  * etc
