description: ! 'Lambda bridge is a generic bridge from Haskell (on a CPU) to VHDL
  on a FPGA.


  In order to use the lambda bridge, you need to set the LB_PATH environment variable.


  For example


  % export LB_PATH=`pwd`/bridges/bin


  If you type


  % make bridges


  Then the package will attempt to build the bridges (and put them in to bridges/bin)
