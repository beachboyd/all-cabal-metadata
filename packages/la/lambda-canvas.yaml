description: ! 'This package is an experimental teaching tool that

  provides the foundation for presenting functional

  idioms with graphical metaphors. The OpenGL canvas

  boilerplate is abstracted away to a simple interface,

  which allows to focus on program logic instead of the

  graphics API. It''s also arguably fun.'
