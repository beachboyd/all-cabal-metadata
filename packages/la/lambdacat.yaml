description: ! "LambdaCat - the Haskell online cat viewer\n=========================================\n\nDriven
  by the frustration modern browsers caused us we started to think about\nhow a browser
  should be.\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n\n1. Mission Statement\n2. Release
  Notes\n3. Installation\n4. Configuration\n\n1. Mission Statement\n--------------------\n\nTo
  us, a browser should be fast, configurable, extendable, secure and easy to\nuse
  with keyboard only. The most important feature is the ability to\ncomfortably display
  online cat-content.\n\nBy extendable and configurable we mean that we like to easily
  change the\nbehaviour of the application in sourcecode. It should be possible to
  engage in\nnearly every data flow by adopting the configuration.\n\nWith security,
  we mean that every communication and interaction with the net\nshould be controllable.
  Every communication should be deniable by default.\n\nWe like to use keyboard only
  applications since the mouse to keyboard movement\nis time intensive and usually
  breaks the workflow. This is not acceptable.\n\nTill now the mission is _not_ yet
  accomplished.\n\n2. Release Notes\n----------------\n\n### 0.1.0 Haskell the Cat\n\nThis
  is the first code release. Its main purpose is to demonstrate our\nsoftware design.
  The API is currently not stable and is subject to change.\n\nFor now we only provide
  a Glade base UI (GladeUI). In the future we plan to\nadd further UIs which can be
  chosen in the configuration.\n\nThis release is _not_ for production use. Please
  be aware of that.\n\n3. Installation\n---------------\n\nLambdacat can be installed
  from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) using \n'cabal'. \n\n    > cabal update\n
  \   > cabal install lambdacat\n\nYou can also checkout the sources from github and
  compile them yourself.\n\nAfter that the binary of lambdacat can be found in \n\n
  \   ~/.cabal/bin\n\nFor everyday use you should include this path into your PATH
  enviroment\nvariable.\n\n### Installing gtk2hs\n\nIf you have not installed the
  haskell gtk bindings you should do previous to \nthe steps above:\n\n    > cabal
  update\n    > cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools\n    > export PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin\n\n\n\n4.
  Configuration\n----------------\n\nA user configuration can be put in:\n\n  ~/.config/lambdacat/lambdacat.hs\n\nThis
  file has to provide a 'main' function that then invokes the function\n'lambdacat'.\n\nA
  small example how this file might look like is the 'Main.hs'.\nFor further information
  please have a look at the haddock generated API\ndocumentation.\n\nMeow.\n\n"
