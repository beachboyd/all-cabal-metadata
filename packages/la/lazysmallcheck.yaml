description: ! 'Lazy SmallCheck is a library for exhaustive, demand-driven testing
  of

  Haskell programs.  It is based on the idea that if a property holds

  for a partially-defined input then it must also hold for all

  fully-defined refinements of the that input.  Compared to ``eager''''

  input generation as in SmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require

  significantly fewer test-cases to verify a property for all inputs up

  to a given depth.'
