description: |-
  This package contains an implementation of the C99 AST as described in
  <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf>. Sticking closely
  to this standard assures us that the program we deal with is a valid C99
  program.

  Additionally the library comes with a pretty printer.

  The package does not come with handy wrapper and utility functions to write a
  C99 program, it just contains the bare AST. It is highly recommended to use
  the wrapper provided by 'language-c99-simple' and 'language-c99-util' for
  writing programs.
