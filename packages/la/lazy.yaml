description: ! 'Now that we have the \"Strict\" pragma at hand we can finally work
  in Haskell as in a strict language.

  Sometimes though laziness is useful,

  but all Haskellers also know that types keep us safe.

  This library provides laziness as an abstraction with an explicit type-signature,

  and it so happens that this abstraction forms a monad!


  This library takes inspiration from the following blog post:
