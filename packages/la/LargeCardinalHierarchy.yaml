description: ! "Copyright (c) 2010 Stephen E. A. Britton.\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nThe
  LargeCardinalHierarchy module defines a recursively enumerable, countably infinite
  subclass of the logically (consistent) maximal transfinite set-theoretic universe
  ZFC+Con(LargeCardinals) (Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory + Axiom of Choice + All known
  large cardinals consistent with ZFC) via data constructors for each large cardinal
  within the hierarchy and functions over them. The algebraic data type Card is a
  Haskell implementation of the set theoretic proper class of all cardinals, Card.
  Card has value constructors for a countably infinite (aleph-null sized) subset of
  every cardinal type of all known large cardinals consistent with ZFC (Zermelo-Frankel
  Set Theory + Axiom of Choice) or, equivalently, ZF+GCH (Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory
  + Generalized Continuum Hypothesis). "
