description: |-
  This library can be used as a property based testing driver, and more
  generally to find values satisfying a predicate (@a -> Bool@). This
  is done by a size bounded search, and it uses the laziness of the
  predicate to speed up the search by avoiding isomorphic values.

  This is similar to "LazySmallCheck" but uses size instead of depth
  and a faster algorithm.
