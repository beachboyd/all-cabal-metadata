description: ! 'This library can be used as a property based testing driver, and more

  generally to find values satisfying a predicate (@a -> Bool@). This

  is done by a size bounded search, and it uses the laziness of the

  predicate to speed up the search by avoiding isomorphic values.


  This is similar to "LazySmallCheck" but uses size instead of depth

  and a faster algorithm.'
