  A library to do naughty things with
  [io-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams).

  It let's you:

  -   convert `InputStream`s to lazy lists
  -   build lazy lists by feeding an `OutputStream`
  -   convert `InputStream ByteString`s to lazy `ByteStrings`

  This can be handy when you are interfacing with other libraries that do
  the right thing in the presence of lazy IO, but don't provide an
  io-streams interface. Of course, the correct solution is to contribute
  the io-streams interface.
