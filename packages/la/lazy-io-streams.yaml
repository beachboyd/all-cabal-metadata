description: ! 'A library to do naughty things with

  [io-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams).


  It let''s you:


  -   convert `InputStream`s to lazy lists

  -   build lazy lists by feeding an `OutputStream`

  -   convert `InputStream ByteString`s to lazy `ByteStrings`


  This can be handy when you are interfacing with other libraries that do

  the right thing in the presence of lazy IO, but don''t provide an

  io-streams interface. Of course, the correct solution is to contribute

  the io-streams interface.
