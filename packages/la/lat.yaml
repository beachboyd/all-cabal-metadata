description: ! 'lat (Linux Alert Tracker) is a tool for tracking security alerts published

  on Linux Weekly News (http://lwn.net/Security/).  It does this by scraping

  information from the site and recording it in a local database (sqlite3).

  Alerts are organised by distribution in the same way as on the LWN site.

  They can also be filtered so that only alerts on packages of interest to

  the user are shown.

  It is also possible to directly from the tool raise a bug in a bugtracker

  based on an alert.  (Only Jira is supported yet.)

  The envisioned user is someone who''s interested in following the security

  alerts of a specific distribution, e.g. someone who''s basing a project on

  a sub-set of packages from a distribution.'
