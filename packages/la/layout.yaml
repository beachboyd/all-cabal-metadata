description: ! 'A library for turning values into text or markup. Flexibility

  is achieved by separating the semantics from the formatting

  implementation. This way, a function can output, for example,

  a table, which can then be rendered to any format.

  This library provides ''standard'' objects that can be formatted,

  in module @Text.Layout.Objects@. It also provides data types for

  a few formats. These data types are glued together with

  instances of @Convertible@'
