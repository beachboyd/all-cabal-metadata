description: ! 'List-like data structures implemented using nested data types and
  polymorphic

  recursion. Also called \"n-ary random access lists\". They supports @O(log(n))@
  lookup

  while still having amortized @O(1)@ access to the left end of the sequence.

  Somewhat similar to finger trees, but much simpler, and the ternary and

  quaternary versions are also more memory efficient; however, modifying

  the right end of the sequence is still slow. See "Data.Nested.Seq"

  for general comments and "Data.Nested.Seq.Binary.Lazy" for an explanation

  of the data structure.'
