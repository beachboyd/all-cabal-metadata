synopsis: Simple network sockets usage patterns.
changelog: ! "# Version 0.4.2\n\n* Deprecate `sendMany` in favor of `sendLazy`.\n\n*
  Generalize return type of `serve`.\n\n* Silence all synchronous exceptions on socket
  shutdown and close.\n\n* Better exception handling everywhere.\n\n* Added dependency
  on `safe-exceptions`.\n\n* Added `listenSock`.\n\n* Improved documentation.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.4.1\n\n* Fix `HostAny` so that IPv6 addresses are correctly included as
  well. See #22.\n\n* Implement a very crude version of _Happy Eyeballs_ (RFC 8305).
  See #15.\n\n* Remove upper bounds from all dependencies other than `base`.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.4.0.5\n\n* Bump upper bound on `transformers` dependency.\n\n\n# Version
  0.4.0.4\n\n* Bump upper bound on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.3\n\n*
  Bump upper bound on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.2\n\n* Workaround
  `sendLazy` build issues in Windows 8 (see #13).\n\n* Bump upper bound on `network`
  dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.1\n\n* Add `sendLazy` and `sendMany` to `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.4\n\n* Bump lower and upper bounds `exceptions` dependency. Replacing
  some\n  uses of `MonadCatch` with `MonadMask.\n\n* Bump upper bound on `network`
  dependency.\n\n* Bump upper bound on `transformers` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.3.1\n\n*
  Bumped upper-bounds on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.3.0\n\n* Re-export
  `Network.Socket.close` at `Network.Simple.TCP`, except\n  called `closeSock`.\n\n*
  Re-export `Socket`, `SockAddr`, `HostName` and `ServiceName` from\n  `Network.Socket`
  at `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n* Generalize the `IO` monad by using `MonadIO` and `MonadCatch`
  (from\n  the `exceptions` library).\n\n\n# Version 0.2.1.0\n\n* Export `send` and
  `recv` from `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n* Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo`
  from `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0.1\n\n* FIX: `acceptFork` now properly
  closes the connection socket, even in\n  case of asynchronous exceptions.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.2.0.0\n\n* `Network.Simple.TCP.serveFork` was renamed to `serve`, and
  the previous\n  function named `serve` was removed.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0.1\n\n*
  Fixed typos, including the maintainer email.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0.0\n\n* First release.\n"

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple.png)](http://travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple)


  Haskell library abstracting over simple network sockets usage patterns.

  Currently, only TCP sockets are supported. Support for UDP and Unix

  sockets is planned for future versions.
