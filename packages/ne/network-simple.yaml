synopsis: Simple network sockets usage patterns.
changelog: ! "# Version 0.4.3\n\n* Added SOCKS5 proxy support using the `socks` library.
  See functions\n  `connectSOCKS5` and `connectSockSOCKS5`.\n\n* Increased connection
  timeout.\n\n* Client side sockets now have `SO_KEEPALIVE` and `TCP_NODELAY` on by
  default.\n\n* Server side sockets now have `SO_KEEPALIVE` on by default.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.4.2\n\n* Deprecate `sendMany` in favor of `sendLazy`.\n\n* Generalize
  return type of `serve`.\n\n* Silence all synchronous exceptions on socket shutdown
  and close.\n\n* Better exception handling everywhere.\n\n* Added dependency on `safe-exceptions`.\n\n*
  Added `listenSock`.\n\n* Improved documentation.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.1\n\n* Fix `HostAny`
  so that IPv6 addresses are correctly included as well. See #22.\n\n* Implement a
  very crude version of _Happy Eyeballs_ (RFC 8305). See #15.\n\n* Remove upper bounds
  from all dependencies other than `base`.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.5\n\n* Bump upper
  bound on `transformers` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.4\n\n* Bump upper bound
  on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.3\n\n* Bump upper bound on `exceptions`
  dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.2\n\n* Workaround `sendLazy` build issues in Windows
  8 (see #13).\n\n* Bump upper bound on `network` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.1\n\n*
  Add `sendLazy` and `sendMany` to `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n\n# Version 0.4\n\n* Bump
  lower and upper bounds `exceptions` dependency. Replacing some\n  uses of `MonadCatch`
  with `MonadMask.\n\n* Bump upper bound on `network` dependency.\n\n* Bump upper
  bound on `transformers` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.3.1\n\n* Bumped upper-bounds
  on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.3.0\n\n* Re-export `Network.Socket.close`
  at `Network.Simple.TCP`, except\n  called `closeSock`.\n\n* Re-export `Socket`,
  `SockAddr`, `HostName` and `ServiceName` from\n  `Network.Socket` at `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n*
  Generalize the `IO` monad by using `MonadIO` and `MonadCatch` (from\n  the `exceptions`
  library).\n\n\n# Version 0.2.1.0\n\n* Export `send` and `recv` from `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n*
  Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo` from `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n\n# Version
  0.2.0.1\n\n* FIX: `acceptFork` now properly closes the connection socket, even in\n
  \ case of asynchronous exceptions.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0.0\n\n* `Network.Simple.TCP.serveFork`
  was renamed to `serve`, and the previous\n  function named `serve` was removed.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.1.0.1\n\n* Fixed typos, including the maintainer email.\n\n\n# Version
  0.1.0.0\n\n* First release.\n"

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple.png)](http://travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple)


  Haskell library abstracting over simple network sockets usage patterns.

  Currently, only TCP sockets are supported. Support for UDP and Unix

  sockets is planned for future versions.
