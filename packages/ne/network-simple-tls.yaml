changelog: |
  # Version 0.3.2

  * Added `sendLazy`.

  * Fixed space leak on `recv`. See issue #13.


  # Version 0.3.1

  * Added SOCKS5 proxy support. See functions `connectOverSOCKS5` and
    `connectTlsOverSOCKS5`.

  * Use `safe-exceptions`.


  # Version 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Changed type of the following functions:
    `getDefaultClientSettings`, `makeClientSettings`, `updateClientParams`,
    `clientParams`, `makeServerSettings`, `updateServerParams`, `serverParams`.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Only TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are supported by default.

  * Server's choice of ciphers are always prefered over client's.

  * Server code will mandate strong cipher requirements, client code will be more
    permissive.

  * Compatible with `tls-1.4`

  * Remove upper bounds for all dependencies except `base`.


  # Version 0.2.1

  * Ensure that the Socket TLS backend always receive the expected number
    of bytes. This issue showed up as the following exception previously:

        Error_Packet "partial packet: expecting 100 bytes, got: 6"


  # Version 0.2.0

  * Re-export `Socket`, `SockAddr`, `HostName` and `ServiceName` from
    `Network.Socket` at `Network.Simple.TCP.TLS`.

  * Re-export `Context` from `Network.TLS` at `Network.Simple.TCP.TLS`.

  * Generalize the `IO` monad by using `MonadIO` and `MonadCatch` (from
    the `exceptions` library).

  * Added `makeClientContext`, `makeServerContext` and `useTlsThenClose`.

  * Use `Socket` as a TLS backend instead of `Handle`.

  * Drop dependency on `monad-random-api` in favour of `monad-random`.

  * Dependency bumps.


  # Version 0.1.1.0

  * Export 'Network.Socket.withSocketsDo' from 'Network.Simple.TCP.TLS'.


  # Version 0.1.0.1

  * Dependency bumps.


  # Version 0.1.0.0

  * First release.

  # network-simple-tls

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple-tls.png)](http://travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple-tls)

  Haskell library simplifying the useage of TLS secured network
  connections. Currently, only TCP sockets are supported. This package
  aims to be similar and compatible with the `network-simple` package.
