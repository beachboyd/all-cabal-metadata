synopsis: Simple interface to TLS secured network sockets.
changelog: ! "# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Changed type of the following functions:\n
  \ `getDefaultClientSettings`, `makeClientSettings`, `updateClientParams`,\n  `clientParams`,
  `makeServerSettings`, `updateServerParams`, `serverParams`.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Only TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are supported by default.\n\n* Server's choice of ciphers
  are always prefered over client's.\n\n* Server code will mandate strong cipher requirements,
  client code will be more\n  permissive.\n\n* Compatible with `tls-1.4`\n\n* Remove
  upper bounds for all dependencies except `base`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.1\n\n* Ensure
  that the Socket TLS backend always receive the expected number\n  of bytes. This
  issue showed up as the following exception previously:\n\n      Error_Packet \"partial
  packet: expecting 100 bytes, got: 6\"\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0\n\n* Re-export `Socket`,
  `SockAddr`, `HostName` and `ServiceName` from\n  `Network.Socket` at `Network.Simple.TCP.TLS`.\n\n*
  Re-export `Context` from `Network.TLS` at `Network.Simple.TCP.TLS`.\n\n* Generalize
  the `IO` monad by using `MonadIO` and `MonadCatch` (from\n  the `exceptions` library).\n\n*
  Added `makeClientContext`, `makeServerContext` and `useTlsThenClose`.\n\n* Use `Socket`
  as a TLS backend instead of `Handle`.\n\n* Drop dependency on `monad-random-api`
  in favour of `monad-random`.\n\n* Dependency bumps.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.1.0\n\n*
  Export 'Network.Socket.withSocketsDo' from 'Network.Simple.TCP.TLS'.\n\n\n# Version
  0.1.0.1\n\n* Dependency bumps.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0.0\n\n* First release.\n"

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple-tls.png)](http://travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple-tls)


  Haskell library simplifying the useage of TLS secured network

  connections. Currently, only TCP sockets are supported. This package

  aims to be similar and compatible with the `network-simple` package.
