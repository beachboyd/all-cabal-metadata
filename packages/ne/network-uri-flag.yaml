description: ! 'This empty package does not provide any modules; its sole purpose
  is to

  provide the @network-uri@ Cabal flag logic below so you don''t have to include

  that boilerplate in your @.cabal@ file.


  > flag network-uri

  >   description: Get Network.URI from the network-uri package

  >   default: True

  >

  > library

  >   if flag(network-uri)

  >     build-depends: network-uri >= 2.6, network >= 2.6

  >   else

  >     build-depends: network-uri < 2.6, network < 2.6


  This avoids combining

  @network-uri >= 2.6@ with @network < 2.6@ which both export a

  name-clashing @Network.URI@ module, because

  in network-2.6 the @Network.URI@ module was split off from the

  network package into network-uri-2.6.


  In other words, the logic above makes sure that the @Network.URI@ module

  is provided by either @network-uri@ or by @network@

  (in the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or XOR> sense).


  In order to benefit from this module, simply include it in your

  @build-depends@ declaration alongside @network@ and @network-uri@.


  >   build-depends:

  >     network >= 2.5 && < 2.7,

  >     network-uri >= 2.5 && < 2.7,

  >     network-uri-flag == 0.1.*


  /NOTE: It''s almost always an error to list this package if network and network-uri
  aren''t both listed as well!/'
