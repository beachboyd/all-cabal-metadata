description: ! 'HaNS is a lightweight, pure Haskell network stack that can be used
  for Haskell

  networking in the context of the HaLVM, or with a Linux tap device. It''s very

  cool, but can be hard to integrate into existing systems. This library

  attempts to mitigate some of the translation cost by mimicking some of the

  behavior of the standard Haskell network library.'
