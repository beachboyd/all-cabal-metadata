description: ! 'This library provides pretty-print operators similar to the set provided
  by the Wadler-Leijin pretty-printer.

  The main difference, however, is that it utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm
  for rendering.  This slightly

  reduces the available combinators, but provides a layout engine that optimizes documents,
  minimizing their

  over-wrap and line count.


  The dynamic programming algorithm has pathological cases that cause it to run in
  quadratic time; however,

  typical use on code-like programs should see better run times.  In general, documents
  with many uses of the

  choose combinator will require more time to render.


  This library also provides two simpler rendering engines for uses where the full
  optimal layout engine is not

  necessary.  These engines are much simpler and consume fewer resources.


  NOTE: This library is still in development.  It may contain bugs, performance issues,
  and the interface may change.'
