description: ! 'This package aims to combine the merit of Haskell''s open, strong
  type system

  with flexible Object-oriented programming

  found in dynamically-typed languages such as

  python or ruby.


  @Object@s are implemented as @Map@s from method keys

  to values. Each key specifies its own value types.

  You can add new members at runtime, for any instances of the object (singleton class).

  At the same time, you have typed and runtime-error-free access to the members (duck
  typing).


  See @Data.Object.Dynamic.Examples.PointParticle@ for examples.'
