description: ! "# A Haskell wrapper around the C libpcap library.\n\nIt provides Haskell
  bindings for most of the libpcap API as of libpcap\nversion 0.9.7.  The bindings
  are divided into a very efficient\nlow-level wrapper, Network.Pcap.Base, and a higher-level
  module,\nNetwork.Pcap, that's easier to use.\n\nTo install:\n\n    cabal install
  pcap\n\n\n# Get involved!\n\nPlease report bugs via the\n[github issue tracker](https://github.org/bos/pcap).\n\nThere's
  also a [git mirror](http://github.com/bos/pcap):\n\n* `git clone git://github.com/bos/pcap.git`\n\nMaster
  [Mercurial repository](http://bitbucket.org/bos/pcap):\n\n* `hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bos/pcap`\n\n(You
  can create and contribute changes using either Mercurial or git.)\n\n\n# Authors\n\nThis
  library was originally written by Gregory Wright, with contributions\nby Dominic
  Steinitz.  The current maintainer is Bryan O'Sullivan,\n<bos@serpentine.com>.\n"
