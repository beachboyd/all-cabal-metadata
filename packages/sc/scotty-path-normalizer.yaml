description: ! "# Scotty path normalizer\n\nThis library provides a [Scotty] action
  that normalizes the HTTP request target\nas if it were a Unix file path. When the
  path normalization action detects a\npath that can be simplified in one of the following
  ways, it issues a [redirect]\nto a more canonical path.\n\n1. Remove trailing slashes:
  `https://typeclasses.com/contravariance/`\n   becomes `https://typeclasses.com/contravariance`\n2.
  Remove double slashes: `https://typeclasses.com//web-servers////lesson-4`\n   becomes
  `https://typeclasses.com/web-servers/lesson-4`\n3. Remove `.` segments, because
  `.` represents \"the current directory\":\n   `https://typeclasses.com/ghc/./scoped-type-variables`
  becomes\n   `https://typeclasses.com/ghc/scoped-type-variables`\n4. Remove segments
  of the form `xyz/..`, because `..` represents \"the parent\n   directory\": `https://typeclasses.com/python/../javascript/monoidal-folds`\n
  \  becomes `https://typeclasses.com/javascript/monoidal-folds`\n\nThe typical way
  to apply this to your Scotty server is to put\n`addPathNormalizer` at the top of
  your `ScottyM` app definition.\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified Web.Scotty as Scotty\nimport
  Web.Scotty.PathNormalizer (addPathNormalizer)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain =\n    Scotty.scotty
  3000 $\n      do\n        addPathNormalizer\n\n        Scotty.get (Scotty.capture
  \"/:word\") $\n          do\n            beam <- Scotty.param (Data.Text.Lazy.pack
  \"word\")\n            Scotty.html $ fold\n                [ Data.Text.Lazy.pack
  \"<h1>Scotty, \"\n                , beam\n                , Data.Text.Lazy.pack
  \" me up!</h1>\"\n                ]\n```\n\n  [Scotty]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty\n\n
