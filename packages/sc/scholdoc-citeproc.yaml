synopsis: Scholdoc fork of pandoc-citeproc
changelog: ! "pandoc-citeproc (0.6)\n\n  * The CSL parser has been replaced with a
  new, xml-conduit based module,\n    which does not rely on C libraries and should
  be easier to repair\n    and extend.  The module has been checked against the old
  module with all\n    CSL files in the citeproc repository.  The only differences\n
  \   are with attribute values beginning or ending with a nonbreaking\n    space
  (e.g. with French guillemets), and the new parser's behavior\n    (preserving the
  spaces) is clearly correct.  Parsing was measured as\n    about twice as fast in
  a benchmark.\n  * The `hexpat` cabal flag has been removed.\n  * The old `Text.CSL.Pickle`
  and `Text.CSL.Pickle.*` modules have been\n    removed.\n  * Plural locator labels
  (e.g. 'pp.') are now used for page ranges\n    containing en-dashes (#84).\n  *
  `Elements` has been removed from `Element`.  It was entirely unnecessary,\n    used
  only once (and dispensibly) in `Text.CSL.Eval`.\n    This change results in cleaner
  code.\n  * Improved man page generation.\n  * Updated `chicago-author-date.csl`
  default style.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.5)\n\n  * Revised locator parsing:\n    + parseLocator
  now looks for the \"short\" forms of terms in\n      the style's locale(s).  So,
  in English you'd use \"p.\" or\n      \"ch.\"; in German, \"S.\" or \"Kap.\"\n    +
  Note that the locator label must match what is in the locale\n      file, including
  the period.  Before this change, you could omit\n      the period: \"p 12\" or \"p.
  12\" would both give you a \"page.\"\n      Also, previously, the locators were
  case-insensitive; now they must\n      be in the same case as in the locale.  (English
  \"p.\", German \"S.\".)\n    + \"no.\" no longer gets parsed as a \"note\": closes
  #74.\n    + Text.CSL.Reference no longer exports parseLocator.\n      parseLocator
  is now used only locally, in Text.CSL.Pandoc.\n  * Data.getLocale:  Try 2-letter
  locale lookup if longer locale not found.\n    This should fix an error that occured
  with less common locales\n    (jgm/pandoc#1548).\n  * Added parseNames field to
  Agent.  Set parse-names=true\n    when writing CSL JSON and collapsing suffix or
  particles into\n    first or last names.\n  * Properly handle agents with 'parse-names'
  set to 'true' (#77).\n    Note that parse-names defaults to true if not set, as
  in Zotero.\n  * Reference:  added explicit exports.\n  * Styles:  Added explicit
  export list.\n  * Eval: Fixed isNumericString to recognize en dash (#74).\n  * Allow
  bibtex double quotes to be escaped inside {} (jgm/pandoc#1568).\n  * Titlecase transform
  improvements (#76).\n  * Added two csl files missing from tests/.\n  * Performance
  improvements:  Avoid unnecessary Output groupings.\n    Eliminated some unnecessary
  generic traversals.  (#71)\n  * Makefile:  Use cpphs. Text.CSL.Data seems to break
  on OSX 10.9 without it.\n  * Added prof target to Makefile\n  * Test suite: don't
  exit with success if there were errors!\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.4.0.1)\n\n  * Interpret
  date literals with underscores (e.g. \"2004_2006\") as ranges.\n    This covers
  a common workaround for a deficiency in Zotero (#65).\n  * Correctly handle \"literal\"
  in CSL date (#65).\n  * Fixed erroneous capitalization of the first ibid. in a citation,\n
  \   even in the middle of a sentence (#68).  Removed \"ibid-c\",\n    \"ibid-locator-c\"
  classifications.\n  * Pandoc:  Capitalize first word of citation note, unless span=nocase.\n
  \   Previously we only capitalized citations.  This captures ibid\n    and the like.\n
  \ * Text.CSL.Util.toCapital:  respect `<span class=\"nocase\">`.\n  * Turn small
  caps into SmallCaps element in reading CSL JSON (#67).\n    Either the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">
  or the <sc>\n    variant may be used.\n  * Added \"ca\", \"c\", \"et\" to list of
  short words in titlecase transforms\n    (#66).\n  * Fixed some errors in the no-author
  test case.\n  * test-pandoc-citeproc:  Avoid running tests twice!\n  * Check for
  en dash in checking for page ranges (#70).\n  * Removed unused texmath build-depend.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.4)\n\n  * Fixed #58 - previously not all substitute alternatives were tried.\n
  \ * Made first parameter of OName an Agent, not a String (API change).\n    Also
  moved Agent from Reference to Style.\n  * test-pandoc-citeproc: run tests on all
  matching files in the directory.\n    This removes the need to recompile when new
  tests are added.\n  * Style: Fixed appendWithPunct (mappend for Formatted).  One
  definition\n    was wrong, causing commas to be lost in certain places (#57).\n
  \ * Support \\nocite{*}.  If the `nocite` metadata filed contains a citation\n    with
  identifier `*`, all entries in the bibliography are included\n    in the references
  (#64).\n  * Bump upper bound for aeson.\n  * Removed span nodecor around 'ser.'
  (#60).\n  * Print series as \"3rd ser.\" (using locale's ordinal) (#60).\n  * Added
  scaffolding for 'ordinalize' and infrastructure for\n    accessing locale information
  to Bibtex.\n  * Export new parseLocale from Text.CSL.Parser.\n  * Move punctuation
  before fn in in-text citation before punctuation (#59).\n  * Updated locales and
  chicago-author-date.csl.\n  * Use collection-title for series, even for articles
  (#60).\n  * Fixed locator parsing so capital roman numerals are legal numbers (#61).\n
  \ * Map bookinbook -> chapter (#62).\n  * Better error message from parseString.\n
  \ * Remove space before superscript citation (pandoc #1327).\n  * Fixed spurious
  \"et al\" problem (#27).\n  * Match biblatex's method for separating von from last
  name, for biblatex.\n    For bibtex, we match the documented bibtex algorithm as
  before (#50).\n    Test case:  Drummond de Andrade, Carlos.\n    bibtex makes \"Drummond
  de\" a dropping particle.\n    biblatex takes \"Drummond de Andrade\" to be the
  last name.\n  * Leave off bibliography if `suppress-bibliography` has a true value\n
  \   in the document metadata (#40, with thanks to Jesse Rosenthal).\n  * Try empty
  (null) 'csl' as if no 'csl' was specified.\n    (The default chicago-author-date.csl
  is then used.)\n  * Fixed #51:  empty braces with date range.\n  * Set pageFirst
  automatically from page range (#31).\n  * Bibtex input: set page-first automatically.\n
  \ * Fixed capitalization of first word in sentence (#25).\n    E.g. \"foo bar baz:
  bazbaz foo\" should turn into\n    \"Foo Bar Baz: Bazbaz Foo\" in titlecase, but
  was turning into\n    \"foo Bar Baz: bazbaz Foo.\"\n  * pandoc-citeproc:  Allow
  conversion of mods bibliographies (#28).\n  * readCSLFile now supports dependent
  styles (#30).\n  * Removed network flag.  We now use pandoc's fetchItem.\n  * Changed
  type of findFile, so it returns a Maybe.\n  * Documented fact that you can specify
  a URL under 'csl:'.\n  * Added locale parameter to readCSLFile (API change).\n    readCSLFile
  also now looks in ~/.csl for the file, if it isn't\n    found locally.\n  * Moved
  findFile to Util.\n  * Bibtex/biblatex:  map \"unpublished\" to \"speech\" if\n
  \   the record contains \"eventtitle\", \"eventdate\", or \"venue\".\n    Otherwise
  map it to \"manuscript\" as before (#44).\n  * Look for chicago-author-date.csl
  in ~/.csl if no csl specified.\n    If not found there, use the chicago-author-date.csl
  that comes with\n    the distribution (#48).\n  * Improved case transform behavior
  with punctuation.\n    Previously capitalization might change after a word-internal
  period\n    or apostrophe.  Now internal punctuation only signals a word\n    boundary
  if it is a dash or single quote character.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.3.1)\n\n  * Marked
  final heading (if present) as \"unnumbered\" (pandoc #1277).\n  * Treat empty 'references'
  (empty string) as empty list.\n  * Fixed titlecase transformation of words containing
  '.\n  * Fixed punctuation in notes.\n  * Improved test suite.\n  * FromJSON for
  Formatted: handle block lists as well as inline.\n  * Require yaml >= 0.8.8.2.\n
  \ * Fixed spacing problem with citations in notes in footnote styles\n    (pandoc
  #1036).\n  * Updated chicago-author-date.csl and locales (#34).\n  * Move punctuation
  inside quotes, depending on style.  This is activated by\n    the `punctuation-in-quote`
  locale option, which has a default\n    per locale but can be overridden in the
  style.  This gives more flexibility.\n    (Thanks to Jesse Rosenthal.)\n  * Moved
  `isPunctuationInQuote` to `Text.CSL.Style` and rewrote.\n    Previously it was in
  `Text.CSL.Output.Pandoc`.\n    It doesn't need to use generics and no longer does.\n
  \ * Fixed recognition of \"byzantine\" names.  Names with curly apostrophes were\n
  \   being counted as non-byzantine, and printed given-first with no space\n    (#39).\n
  \ * Fixed representation of reference types to conform to CSL (#24):\n    `motion_picture`,
  `legal_case`, `musical_score`, `personal_communication`.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.3.0.1)\n\n
  \ * Require ghc-prim if ghc < 7.6 (needed for generics).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.3)\n\n
  \ * Removed biblio2yaml.  Instead, use pandoc-citeproc with the\n    --bib2yaml
  or --bib2json option.  (#20)\n  * pandoc-citeproc --bib2json will convert bibtex/biblatex
  to\n    CSL compatible JSON bibliographies.\n  * Updated locale files for correct
  textual date ranges\n    in e.g. the da-DK locale.  Use form=\"ordinal\" instead
  of a period\n    as suffix.  (#16, #18)\n  * Support new langid and langidopts biblatex
  fields. (#11)\n  * Made test-pandoc-citeproc work in all locales. (#19)\n    It
  now tests the executable rather than the library function.\n  * Fixed disambiguation
  with multivolume works (#14).\n  * Improved titlecase/unTitlecase to be sensitive
  to colons,\n    question marks, and exclamation marks, after which the\n    next
  character sohuld be capitalized even in sentence case\n    (pandoc #1102).\n  *
  The \"locale\" filed in metadata will now override a style's\n    default locale.
  \ This can also be set by the command line:\n    --metadata locale=fr-FR (#10).\n
  \ * Use CSL-compatible date-parts for dates in YAML/JSON\n    bibliographies.\n
  \ * Made FromJSON for Reference more forgiving.  Suitable strings\n    are coerced
  into integer values.  (pandoc #1094)\n  * Fixed extra punctuation at end of footnote
  (#13).\n  * Reference:  Always use array in JSON for dates, agents.\n  * Bibtex
  parser:  Don't fail on entry with no title.\n  * Bibliography output: 'given' is
  now a string, not an array.\n    The string will be split on spaces into a list
  of given names.\n    Note that an array can also be used.  But we write\n    a plain
  string, to match the  citeproc json schema.\n  * Fixed spacing bug in date ranges
  (#7).\n  * Names:  Fixed formatLabel so it works for editortranslator.\n    This
  fixes a bug for cases where editor = translator (#9).\n  * Text.CSL.Eval.Date:  Fixed
  bugs with date ranges.\n    Ranges within the same year were raising an error \"Prelude.init:
  empty\n    list\" (#7).\n  * Util: Export tr' and init'.\n  * Text.CSL.Proc.Disamb:
  \ Correct definition of allTheSame.\n  * Improved disambiguation.  Now we correctly
  handle the case with no\n    author but title.\n  * Consider names too when determining
  date disambiguations.\n    Previously if you had two distinct names needing disambiguation
  for\n    the same date, the letters would not start over with 'a' for the second\n
  \   name.\n  * Added Generic instances for the types in Style and Reference.\n"

description: ! "Scholdoc-Citeproc\n=================\n\n### A fork of [Pandoc-Citeproc][pandoc-citeproc]
  for [Scholdoc][scholdoc]\n\n**Current stable version:** 0.6\n\n**Development build
  status** [![build status][scholarly-devel-travisimage]][travis_stat]  \n**Stable
  build status** [![build status][scholarly-travisimage]][travis_stat]\n\nThis package
  is a fork of [Pandoc-Citeproc][pandoc-citeproc]. It is intended to\nsupport the
  development of [Scholdoc][scholdoc], a fork of [Pandoc][pandoc]\nthat understands
  [ScholarlyMarkdown][scholmd]. It is mean to be used as a\nfilter with [Scholdoc][scholdoc]
  to resolve and format citations using a\nbibliography file and a [CSL stylesheet][csl].
  It can also be used (with\n`--bib2yaml` or `--bib2json` options) to convert a bibliography
  to a YAML\nformat that can be put directly into a ScholarlyMarkdown document or
  to CSL\nJSON. Bibliographies can be in any of several formats, but BibTeX/BibLaTeX\n`.bib`
  database files are the best supported. For more information, consult the\noriginal
  README file of `pandoc-citeproc`, which is moved to\n[`README-pandoc-citeproc.md`][citeproc-readme-blob].\n\n`scholdoc-citeproc`
  is currently just a trivial fork just so it can compile\nagainst [Scholdoc-Types][scholdoc-types]
  and [Scholdoc][scholdoc] instead of\n[Pandoc-Types][pandoc-types] and [Pandoc][pandoc],
  without polluting the\n`pandoc-citeproc` package and executable namespace on the
  user's system. In the\nfuture, enhancements and modifications made as part of the
  [Scholdoc][scholdoc]\nproject will be introduced here first.\n\nThe version number
  of this package is kept in sync with [pandoc-citeproc].\n\n[scholmd]: http://scholarlymarkdown.com\n[scholdoc]:
