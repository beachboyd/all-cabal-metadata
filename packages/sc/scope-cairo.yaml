description: ! 'scope-cairo is a Cairo rendering backend for scope, which is a

  a framework for plotting time-series data using zoom-cache files.


  For more information on scope and zoom-cache, see their packages:


  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scope>


  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/zoom-cache>


  This package includes a Gtk/Cairo application. It''s a desktop

  application with a /File/ menu; remember those? wow! This will probably

  be split out into a separate package later, and there''ll be a webby

  javascripty version too, but for now there''s this desktop app.


  To run it, simply:


  @

  $ cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools scope-cairo

  $ scope-cairo

  @


  Then, select /File->Open/ from the menubar, with your mouse: there''s no

  swiping gestures back here, baby! Four (yes, 4) demo files are included

  in this version of the package. Choose one, and it will be drawn in the

  window. Amazing! It should look something like what you saw in the post

  you read about this in, but more personal because now it''s happening to

  you.


  Zoom in with the scroll wheel on your mouse. If you don''t have a scroll

  wheel, use the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard. If you don''t have

  up and down arrows /you are elite/!


  Pan around by dragging it. There''s a scrollbar too if you''re into that.


  Load up another file! It will also be drawn. Zoom in and out and pan

  around, yay! Life is gooood!'
