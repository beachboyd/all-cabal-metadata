description: ! 'This package provides constants and conversion factors commonly used
  in

  mathematics and physical sciences. The motivation is to make it easier

  to use ghci for quick scientific calculations [without the need to

  search for the constant values over the internet.] To make it even

  friendlier, if multiple conventional names of a constant exist, they all

  are provided by this package. Wherever possible, TeX-style named

  constants are also provided.


  This package utilizes untyped values (i.e. untyped in terms of

  @unittyped@, @dimensional@, and similar libraries); and unless otherwise

  specified, the constants are in SI units: mass in kilograms, length in

  meters, etc.


  Due to floating-point calculation errors and to improve accuracy, the

  package internally uses exact values even in cases where constants can

  be mathematically derived one from another.


  Most of the constants values were taken from the Fundamental Constants

  Data Center of the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (by Barry N.

  Taylor of the Data Center in close collaboration with Peter J. Mohr of

  the Physical Measurement Laboratory''s Atomic Physics Division.)
