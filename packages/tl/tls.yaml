  ## Version 1.4.1

  - Enable X25519 in default parameters [#265](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/265)
  - Checking EOF in bye [#262] (https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/262)
  - Improving validation in DH key exchange [#256](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/256)
  - Handle TCP reset during handshake [#251](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/251)
  - Accepting hlint suggestions.

  ## Version 1.4.0

  - Wrap renegotiation failures with HandshakeFailed [#237](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/237)
  - Improve selection of server certificate and use "signature_algorithms" extension [#236](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/236)
  - Change Bytes to ByteString and deprecate the Bytes type alias [#230](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/230)
  - Session compression and SNI [#223](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/223)
  - Deprecating ciphersuite_medium. Putting WARNING to ciphersuite_all since this includes RC4 [#153](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/153) [#222](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/222)
  - Removing NPN [#214](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/214)
  - Supporting RSAPSS defined in TLS 1.3 [#207](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/207)
  - Supporting X25519 and X448 in the IES style. [#205](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/205)
  - Strip leading zeros in DHE premaster secret [#201](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/201)

  FEATURES:

  - RSASSA-PSS signatures can be enabled with `supportedHashSignatures`.  This
    uses assignments from TLS 1.3, for example `(HashIntrinsic, SignatureRSApssSHA256)`.
  - Diffie-Hellman with elliptic curves X25519 and X448: This can be enabled with
    `supportedGroups`, which also gives control over curve preference.
  - ECDH with curve P-256 now uses optimized C implementation from package `cryptonite`.

  API CHANGES:

  - Cipher list `ciphersuite_medium` is now deprecated, users are advised to use
    `ciphersuite_default` or `ciphersuite_strong`.  List `ciphersuite_all` is kept
    for compatibility with old servers but this is discouraged and generates a
    warning (this includes RC4 ciphers, see [#153](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/153)
    for reference).
  - Support for NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) has been removed. The replacement
    is ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).
  - Data type `SessionData` now contains fields for compression algorithm and
    client SNI.  A `SessionManager` implementation that serializes/deserializes
    `SessionData` values must deal with the new fields.
  - Module `Network.TLS` exports a type alias named `Bytes` which is now deprecated.
    The replacement is to use strict `ByteString` directly.

  ## Version 1.3.11

  - Using reliable versions of dependent libraries.

  ## Version 1.3.10

  - Selecting a cipher based on "signature_algorithms" [#193](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/193)
  - Respecting the "signature_algorithms" extension [#137](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/137)
  - Fix RSA signature in CertificateVerify with TLS < 1.2 [#189](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/189)
  - Fix ECDSA with TLS 1.0 / TLS 1.1 [#187](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/187)
  - Sending an empty server name from a server if necessary. [#175](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/175)
  - `Network.TLS.Extra` provides Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters in RFC 7919 [#174](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/174)
  - Restore ability to renegotiate[#164](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/164)

  - SNI late checks [#147](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/147)

  ## Version 1.2.13

  - Update x509 dependencies

  ## Version 1.2.9

  - Export TLSParams and HasBackend type names
  - Added FlexibleContexts flag required by ghc-7.9
  - debug: add support for specifying the timeout length in milliseconds.

  ## Version 1.2.7

  - repair retrieve certificate validation, and improve fingerprints

  ## Version 1.2.6 (23 Mar 2014)

  - Fixed socket backend endless loop when the server does not close connection
    properly at the TLS level with the close notify alert.
  - Catch Error_EOF in recvData and return empty data.

  ## Version 1.2.5 (23 Mar 2014)

  - Fixed Server key exchange data being parsed without the correct
    context, leading to not knowing how to parse the structure.
    The bug happens on efficient server that happens to send the ServerKeyXchg
    message together with the ServerHello in the same handshake packet.
    This trigger parsing of all the messages without having set the pending cipher.
    Delay parsing, when this happen, until we know what to do with it.

  ## Version 1.2.4 (23 Mar 2014)

  - Fixed unrecognized name non-fatal alert after client hello.
  - Add SSL3 to the supported list of version by default.
  - Fix cereal lower bound to 0.4.0 minimum

  Native Haskell TLS and SSL protocol implementation for server and client.

  This provides a high-level implementation of a sensitive security protocol,
  eliminating a common set of security issues through the use of the advanced
  type system, high level constructions and common Haskell features.

  Currently implement the SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 protocol,
  and support RSA and Ephemeral (Elliptic curve and regular) Diffie Hellman key exchanges,
  and many extensions.

  Some debug tools linked with tls, are available through the
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tls-debug/>.
