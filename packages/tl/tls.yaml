synopsis: TLS/SSL protocol native implementation (Server and Client)
changelog: ! "## Version 1.4.1\n\n- Enable X25519 in default parameters [#265](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/265)\n-
  Checking EOF in bye [#262] (https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/262)\n- Improving
  validation in DH key exchange [#256](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/256)\n-
  Handle TCP reset during handshake [#251](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/251)\n-
  Accepting hlint suggestions.\n\n## Version 1.4.0\n\n- Wrap renegotiation failures
  with HandshakeFailed [#237](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/237)\n- Improve
  selection of server certificate and use \"signature_algorithms\" extension [#236](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/236)\n-
  Change Bytes to ByteString and deprecate the Bytes type alias [#230](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/230)\n-
  Session compression and SNI [#223](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/223)\n-
  Deprecating ciphersuite_medium. Putting WARNING to ciphersuite_all since this includes
  RC4 [#153](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/153) [#222](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/222)\n-
  Removing NPN [#214](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/214)\n- Supporting
  RSAPSS defined in TLS 1.3 [#207](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/207)\n-
  Supporting X25519 and X448 in the IES style. [#205](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/205)\n-
  Strip leading zeros in DHE premaster secret [#201](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/201)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n-
  RSASSA-PSS signatures can be enabled with `supportedHashSignatures`.  This\n  uses
  assignments from TLS 1.3, for example `(HashIntrinsic, SignatureRSApssSHA256)`.\n-
  Diffie-Hellman with elliptic curves X25519 and X448: This can be enabled with\n
  \ `supportedGroups`, which also gives control over curve preference.\n- ECDH with
  curve P-256 now uses optimized C implementation from package `cryptonite`.\n\nAPI
  CHANGES:\n\n- Cipher list `ciphersuite_medium` is now deprecated, users are advised
  to use\n  `ciphersuite_default` or `ciphersuite_strong`.  List `ciphersuite_all`
  is kept\n  for compatibility with old servers but this is discouraged and generates
  a\n  warning (this includes RC4 ciphers, see [#153](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/153)\n
  \ for reference).\n- Support for NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) has been removed.
  The replacement\n  is ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).\n- Data type
  `SessionData` now contains fields for compression algorithm and\n  client SNI.  A
  `SessionManager` implementation that serializes/deserializes\n  `SessionData` values
  must deal with the new fields.\n- Module `Network.TLS` exports a type alias named
  `Bytes` which is now deprecated.\n  The replacement is to use strict `ByteString`
  directly.\n\n## Version 1.3.11\n\n- Using reliable versions of dependent libraries.\n\n##
  Version 1.3.10\n\n- Selecting a cipher based on \"signature_algorithms\" [#193](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/193)\n-
  Respecting the \"signature_algorithms\" extension [#137](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/137)\n-
  Fix RSA signature in CertificateVerify with TLS < 1.2 [#189](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/189)\n-
  Fix ECDSA with TLS 1.0 / TLS 1.1 [#187](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/187)\n-
  Sending an empty server name from a server if necessary. [#175](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/175)\n-
  `Network.TLS.Extra` provides Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters in
  RFC 7919 [#174](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/174)\n- Restore ability
  to renegotiate[#164](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/164)\n\n## Version
  1.3.9\n\n- Drop support for old GHC.\n- Enable sha384 ciphers and provide `ciphersuite_default`
  as default set of ciphers for common needs [#168](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/168)\n-
  SNI late checks [#147](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/147)\n- Expose the
  HasBackend(..) class fully, so that developers can use TLS over their own channels
  [#149](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/149)\n\n## Version 1.3.8\n\n- Fix
  older GHC builds\n\n## Version 1.3.7\n\n- Disable SHA384 based cipher, as they don't
  work properly yet.\n\n## Version 1.3.6\n\n- Add new ciphers\n- Improve some debugging

  backend endless loop when the server does not close connection\n  properly at the
  TLS level with the close notify alert.\n- Catch Error_EOF in recvData and return
  empty data.\n\n## Version 1.2.5 (23 Mar 2014)\n\n- Fixed Server key exchange data
  being parsed without the correct\n  context, leading to not knowing how to parse
  the structure.\n  The bug happens on efficient server that happens to send the ServerKeyXchg\n
  \ message together with the ServerHello in the same handshake packet.\n  This trigger
  parsing of all the messages without having set the pending cipher.\n  Delay parsing,
  when this happen, until we know what to do with it.\n\n## Version 1.2.4 (23 Mar
  2014)\n\n- Fixed unrecognized name non-fatal alert after client hello.\n- Add SSL3
  to the supported list of version by default.\n- Fix cereal lower bound to 0.4.0
  minimum\n\n## Version 1.2.3 (22 Mar 2014)\n\n- Fixed handshake records not being

description: ! 'Native Haskell TLS and SSL protocol implementation for server and
  client.


  This provides a high-level implementation of a sensitive security protocol,

  eliminating a common set of security issues through the use of the advanced

  type system, high level constructions and common Haskell features.


  Currently implement the SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 protocol,

  and support RSA and Ephemeral (Elliptic curve and regular) Diffie Hellman key exchanges,

  and many extensions.


  Some debug tools linked with tls, are available through the
