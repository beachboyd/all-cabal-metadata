changelog: |+
  * Version 1.4.1
    - Support for Cabal 2
    - Updates to build infrastructure
    - Fixes memory leak

  * Version 1.3
    - Corrects collapsing logic.
    - Change node coloring in clusters:
      * Clusters are displayed with various shades of gray
      * Nodes in a cluster are all the same color
    - Change to clustering logic:  by default, a module that has the same
      name as a cluster will be rendered inside the cluster.  One can tell
      that the module is different because it will still have the color of
      modules from the cluster "above".  Also, the module has a border to
      empahsize the difference.
      This behavior may be disabled using `--no-module-in-cluster`

  * Version 1.2.9
    - Support for Cabal: if we find a cabal file, we add all modules in it
    - Render `{-# SOURCE #-}` imports specially.

  * Version 1.2.7
    Correct the prunning logic.

  * Version 1.2.6

    Add support for parsing GHC's `.import` files.  These may be produced
    by running GHC with `-ddump-minimal-imports`

  * Version 1.2.5

    Add support for pruning the dependecy graph.

  * Version 1.2.3

    [Collapse Modules]
    The flag `--collapse-module` (`-C` for short) adds a new mode of collapsing
    multiples nodes into a single one.  This is similar to `--collapse` except
    that the parameter can refer either to a module name, or to a module prefix.
    So, for example, `--collapse-module=A.B` will use a single node for the
    module A.B (if there is one), as well as for any module that starts with
    the prefix A.B (e.g., A.B.C).

    "Collapsed" nodes are represented with a box.

    Collapsed nodes corresponding to modules have a border, while ones which
    correspond to just a prefix do not have a border.


    [Color Schemes]
    The flag `--colors` (`-s` for short) enables users to choose from
    a set of predefined color schemes.


  * Version 1.2.2

    [Show Version]
    The flag `--version` (`-v` for short) shows graphmod's version.
