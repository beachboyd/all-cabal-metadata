description: ! "Tool to produce dependency diagram from the set of *.hs files. Diagram\nwill
  include specified top-level declaration and all user-defined\ntypes referencd from
  there (recursively).\n\nTo see dependency diagram for type MegaData and all other
  types\nreferenced from there, use:\n\n        graphtype MegaData *.hs\n\nUser can
  choose to omit types and newtypes that do not contain\nanything other than library
  types - this could be useful to unclutter\nreally large diagrams. Try running \"graphtype
  --trim ...\" and see\nwhether it helps you or otherwise.\n"
