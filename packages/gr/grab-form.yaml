  @Grab@ is an @Applicative@ for consuming lists of
  (name, value) parameters.

  == Example

  Parser:

  > nameStateAndQAs :: Grab EnglishSentence (Text, Text, [QA])
  > nameStateAndQAs =
  >     (,,)
  >         <$> at "name" (only text)
  >         <*> at "state" (only text)
  >         <*> at "security" (only (natList (only qa)))
  >
  > qa :: Grab EnglishSentence QA
  > qa =
  >     QA
  >         <$> at "Q" (only text)
  >         <*> at "A" (only text)

  Input:

  > name:           Alonzo
  > state:          Montana
  > security[1].Q:  What is your favorite hobby?
  > security[1].A:  watching cars
  > security[2].Q:  What is your oldest sibling's name?
  > security[2].A:  melman
  > security[3].Q:  What was the make and model of your first car?
  > security[3].A:  bmw x5

  Output:

  > ( "Alonzo"
  > , "Montana"
  > , [ QA
  >       { qa_question = "What is your favorite hobby?"
  >       , qa_answer = "watching cars"
  >       }
  >   , QA
  >       { qa_question = "What is your oldest sibling's name?"
  >       , qa_answer = "melman"
  >       }
  >   , QA
  >       { qa_question = "What was the make and model of your first car?"
  >       , qa_answer = "bmw x5"
  >       }
  >   ]
  > )
