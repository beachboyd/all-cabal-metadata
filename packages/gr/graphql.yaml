  # Change Log
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  ## [0.6.0.0] - 2019-11-27
  ### Changed
  - `Language.GraphQL.Encoder` moved to `Language.GraphQL.AST.Encoder`.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Parser` moved to `Language.GraphQL.AST.Parser`.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Lexer` moved to `Language.GraphQL.AST.Lexer`.
  - All `Language.GraphQL.AST.Value` data constructor prefixes were removed. The
    module should be imported qualified.
  - All `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core.Value` data constructor prefixes were removed.
    The module should be imported qualified.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core.Object` is now just a HashMap.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Transform` is isn't exposed publically anymore.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Schema.resolve` accepts a selection `Seq` (`Data.Sequence`)
    instead of a list. Selections are stored as sequences internally as well.
  - Add a reader instance to the resolver's monad stack. The Reader contains
    a Name/Value hashmap, which will contain resolver arguments.

  ### Added
  - Nested fragment support.

  ### Fixed
  - Consume ignored tokens after `$` and `!`. I mistakenly assumed that
    `$variable` is a single token, same as `Type!` is a single token. This is not
    the case, for example `Variable` is defined as `$ Name`, so these are two
    tokens, therefore whitespaces and commas after `$` and `!` should be
    consumed.

  ### Improved
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Parser.type_`: Try type parsers in a variable
    definition in a different order to avoid using `but`.

  ### Removed
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Arguments`. Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Argument]`
    instead.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives`. Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives]`
    instead.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinitions`. Use
    `[Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinition]` instead.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.FragmentName`. Use `Language.GraphQL.AST.Name` instead.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Execute.Schema` - It was a resolver list, not a schema.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Schema`: `enum`, `enumA`, `wrappedEnum` and `wrappedEnumA`.
    Use `scalar`, `scalarA`, `wrappedScalar` and `wrappedScalarA` instead.


  ## [0.5.1.0] - 2019-10-22
  ### Deprecated
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Arguments`. Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Argument]`
    instead.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives`. Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives]`
    instead.
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinitions`. Use
    `[Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinition]` instead.

  ### Added
  - Module documentation.
  - Inline fragment support.

  ### Fixed
  - Top-level fragments.
  - Fragment for execution is chosen based on the type.

  ## [0.5.0.1] - 2019-09-10
  ### Added
  - Minimal documentation for all public symbols.

  ### Deprecated
  - `Language.GraphQL.AST.FragmentName`. Replaced with Language.GraphQL.AST.Name.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Execute.Schema` - It is not a schema (at least not a
    complete one), but a resolver list, and the resolvers should be provided by
    the user separately, because the schema can originate from a GraphQL
    document. `Schema` name should be free to provide a data type for the real
    schema later.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Schema`: `enum`, `enumA`, `wrappedEnum` and `wrappedEnumA`.
    There are actually only two generic types in GraphQL: Scalars and objects.
    Enum is a scalar value.

  ### Fixed
  - Parsing block string values.

  ## [0.5.0.0] - 2019-08-14
  ### Added
  - `executeWithName` executes an operation with the given name.
  - Export `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.definition`,
    `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.type'` and `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.directive`.
  - Export `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.value`. Escapes \ and " in strings now.

  ### Changed
  - `Operation` includes now possible operation name which allows to support
    documents with multiple operations.
  - `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.document` and other encoding functions take a
    `Formatter` as argument to distinguish between minified and pretty printing.
  - All encoder functions return `Data.Text.Lazy`.

  ### Removed
  - Unused `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.spaced`.

  ## [0.4.0.0] - 2019-07-23
  ### Added
  - Support for mutations.
  - Error handling (with monad transformers).
  - Nullable types.
  - Arbitrary nested lists support.
  - Potential BOM header parsing.

  ### Changed
  - attoparsec is replaced with megaparsec.
  - The library is now under `Language.GraphQL` (instead of `Data.GraphQL`).
  - HUnit and tasty are replaced with Hspec.
  - `Alternative`/`MonadPlus` resolver constraints are replaced with `MonadIO`.

  ### Removed
  - Duplicates from `Language.GraphQL.AST` already available in
    `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core`.
  - All module exports are now explicit, so private and help functions aren't
    exported anymore.

  ## [0.3] - 2015-09-22
  ### Changed
  - Exact match numeric types to spec.
  - Names follow now the spec.
  - AST slightly different for better readability or easier parsing.
  - Replace golden test for test to validate parsing/encoding.

  ### Added
  - Parsing errors in all cases where `Alternative` is used.
  - GraphQL encoder.

  ### Fixed
  - Expect braces `inputValueDefinitions` instead of parens when parsing.

  ## [0.2.1] - 2015-09-16
  ### Fixed
  - Include data files for golden tests in Cabal package.
  - Support for ghc-7.8.

  ## [0.2] - 2015-09-14
  ### Added
  - Rudimentary parser for `GraphQL` which successfully parses the sample file
    `kitchen-sink.graphql` from `graphql-js` tests.
  - Golden test for `kitchen-sink.grahql` parsing.
  ### Changed
  - Many optional data types in `GraphQl` didn't need to be wrapped in a `Maybe`.
  - Some `newtype`s became type synonyms for easier parsing.

  ## 0.1 - 2015-09-12
  ### Added
  - Data types for the GraphQL language.

  # Haskell GraphQL

  [![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/graphql.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql)
  [![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/belka-ew/graphql/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/belka-ew/graphql)
  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraus-ecms/graphql/master/LICENSE)

  GraphQL implementation in Haskell.

  This implementation is relatively low-level by design, it doesn't provide any
  mappings between the GraphQL types and Haskell's type system and avoids
  compile-time magic. It focuses on flexibility instead, so other solutions can
  be built on top of it.

  ## State of the work

  For now this only provides a parser and a printer for the GraphQL query
  language and allows to execute queries and mutations without the schema
  validation step. But the idea is to be a Haskell port of
  [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).

  For the list of currently missing features see issues marked as
  "[not implemented](https://github.com/caraus-ecms/graphql/labels/not%20implemented)".

  ## Documentation

  API documentation is available through
  [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql).

  You'll also find a small tutorial with some examples under
  [docs/tutorial](https://github.com/caraus-ecms/graphql/tree/master/docs/tutorial).

  ## Contact

  Suggestions, contributions and bug reports are welcome.

  Should you have questions on usage, please open an issue and ask – this helps
  to write useful documentation.

  Feel free to contact on Slack in [#haskell on
  GraphQL](https://graphql.slack.com/messages/haskell/). You can obtain an
  invitation [here](https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/).
