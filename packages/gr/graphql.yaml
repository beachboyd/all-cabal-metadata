changelog: ! "# Change Log\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\n\n## [0.3] - 2015-09-22\n### Changed\n- Exact match numeric types
  to spec.\n- Names follow now the spec.\n- AST slightly different for better readability
  or easier parsing.\n- Replace golden test for test to validate parsing/encoding.\n\n###
  Added\n- Parsing errors in all cases where `Alternative` is used.\n- GraphQL encoder.\n\n###
  Fixed\n- Expect braces `inputValueDefinitions` instead of parens when parsing.\n\n##
  [0.2.1] - 2015-09-16\n### Fixed\n- Include data files for golden tests in Cabal
  package.\n- Support for ghc-7.8.\n\n## [0.2] - 2015-09-14\n### Added\n- Rudimentary
  parser for `GraphQL` which successfully parses the sample file\n  `kitchen-sink.graphql`
  from `graphql-js` tests.\n- Golden test for `kitchen-sink.grahql` parsing.\n###
  Changed\n- Many optional data types in `GraphQl` didn't need to be wrapped in a
  `Maybe`.\n- Some `newtype`s became type synonyms for easier parsing.\n\n## 0.1 -
  2015-09-12\n### Added\n- Data types for the GraphQL language.\n\n[0.3]: https://github.com/jdnavarro/graphql-haskell/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3\n[0.2.1]:

  [![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/graphql.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql)

  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jdnavarro/graphql-haskell.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jdnavarro/graphql-haskell)


  For now this only provides the data types to represent the GraphQL AST,

  but the idea is to be a Haskell port of

  [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). Next releases

  should include:


  - [x] GraphQL AST

  - [x] Parser for the GraphQL language. See TODO for limitations.

  - [x] Printer for GraphQL. This is not pretty yet.

  - [ ] GraphQL Schema AST.

  - [ ] Parser for the GraphQL Schema language.

  - [ ] Printer for the GraphQL Schema language.

  - [ ] Interpreter of GraphQL requests.

  - [ ] Utilities to define GraphQL types and schema.


  See the TODO file for more concrete tasks.
