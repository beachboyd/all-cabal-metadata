synopsis: Extensible Records
changelog: ! '# 0.7.0

  - Simplified `match`

  - Added `Data.Vinyl.Curry`


  # 0.6.0


  Added a `CoRec` (co-record) type constructed in the same style as the existing `Rec`
  type for records. A `CoRec` is an open sum type: a value of `CoRec [a,b,c]` is either
  an `a`, a `b`, *or* a `c`. In contrast a `Rec [a,b,c]` includes an `a`, a `b`, *and*,
  a `c`.


  # 0.5.3


  Added a concise `Show` instance for `Const`.


  # 0.5.2


  Ported the tutorial to haddocks (andrewthad)


  # 0.5.1


  Added utilities for working with the `FieldRec` type.


  # 0.5


  Vinyl 0.5 combines the generality of Vinyl 0.4 with the ease-of-use of previous

  versions by eschewing the defunctionalized type families and just using plain

  type constructors; Vinyl 0.4-style records can be recovered in most cases in a

  modular manner without baking it into the fabric of Vinyl itself.


  Also new in 0.5 is a unified lens-based approach to subtyping, coercion and

  projection.


  # 0.4


  Vinyl 0.4 is a big departure from previous versions, in that it introduces a

  universe encoding as a means to generalize the space of keys from strings to

  any arbitrary space. This means that you can have closed universes for your

  records.

  Vinyl](http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2014-05-19-programming-in-vinyl-bayhac.html).
