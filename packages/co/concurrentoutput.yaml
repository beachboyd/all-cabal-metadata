description: ! 'This library provides a simple interface to output status

  messages from more than one thread.


  It will continue adding information (such as dots, or \"done\")

  to the correct line and continue scrolling when a line is done.


  For example, this screen:


  @

  Thread ThreadId 27: still working... done

  Thread ThreadId 25: still working...

  Thread ThreadId 26: still working...

  _

  @


  will, once thread 25 has finished, look like this:


  @

  Thread ThreadId 25: still working... done

  Thread ThreadId 27: still working... done

  Thread ThreadId 26: still working...

  _

  @


  If standard output is not a terminal, it will only print

  complete lines and not output any control characters.


  At the moment, it can only handle lines that are shorter than

  the terminal. If they are not, output will be garbled again.
