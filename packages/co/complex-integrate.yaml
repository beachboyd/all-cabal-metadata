description: ! "complex-integrate\n=================\n\nSmall and simple library for
  integration of complex functions.\nIntegrates functions along straight lines. Compatible
  with real-valued functions.\nUses Simpson's method.\n\nAs of Oct, 2011 I could not
  find any haskell package which could provide me with something so simple as this.\n\n*cabalized*:
  install with\n\n    $ cabal install complex-integrate\n\nProvides you with only
  a single function:\n\n    integrate f n a b\n\nwhich integrates `f` along a line
  between points `a` and `b` while dividing this line in `n` segments, providing accuracy.\n\n"
