description-type: text
description: ! "I hope for this library to become the standard colour library for
  Haskell.\nMost software does not properly blend colours because they fail to\ngamma-correct
  the colours before blending.  Hopefully by using this library,\nHaskell programs
  dealing with colour blending will avoid this problem.\n\nThere are some optimizing
  RULES pragmas that could be added to improve\npreformance.  If you are having performace
  issues with colour, please\nlet me know, and we will test some of these pragmas.\n\nBug
  reports and any patches are also welcome.  Be warned, I haven't\nextensively tested
  this library yet.\n\n-- \nRussell O'Connor <roconnor@theorem.ca>"
