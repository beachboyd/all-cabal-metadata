description: |-
  The base package's 'Data.Complex' has a 'RealFloat' requirement for
  almost all operations, which rules out uses such as 'Complex Rational'
  or 'Complex Integer'.  This package provides an alternative, putting
  most operations into additional type classes.  Generating instances
  with template haskell helps reduce excessive boilerplate and avoids
  instance overlap.
