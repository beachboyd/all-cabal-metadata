description: ! 'This library implements fast and easy to use CPS-based monad

  transformers.  Most of the usual monad transformers are implemented,

  including ChoiceT, ContT, EitherT, MaybeT and StateT.  Because of

  the design of this library, many other monad transformers are just

  special cases of those, including e.g. ReaderT and WriterT.

  The Control.ContStuff.Simple module also provides simplified monad

  transformer wrappers, which hide the underlying CPS, so you get the

  full performance, but with a simplified interface.  Currently the

  simplified monad transformers are implemented as type synonyms, so

  their flexibility is slightly limited.'
