  and expanded Haddock comments throughout.\r\n  * Fixed allocator mismatch bug in
  Com.Base.getModuleFileName\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2.2 - released 2009-01-27; changes from
  1.2.1\r\n\r\n  * built-in enumeration handling of variants (via the\r\n    IEnumVariant
  interface) was buggy and stale. \r\n\r\n  * Fixed Integer unmarshalling for Variants;
  used to\r\n    go via CURRENCY, now Int64.\r\n  \r\n  * Only buildable on Windows
  platforms.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2.1 - released 2009-01-19; changes from 1.2.0\r\n\r\n
  \ * fix bad mix of allocators, the accidental introduction of the\r\n    combined
  use of the CRT one (malloc()) and the COM task allocaotr\r\n    led to spurious
  MM crashes.\r\n  * drop 'haskell98' dependencies\r\n\r\n"
