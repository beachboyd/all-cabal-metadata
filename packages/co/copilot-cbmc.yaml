description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Copilot-Language/copilot-cbmc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Copilot-Language/copilot-cbmc)\n\nOverview\n========\n[copilot-cbmc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-cbmc)
  A tool to\ngenerate a driver using CBMC, a third-party tool (see Dependencies below)
  that\nproves that the code generated by different C back-ends is equivalent.\nCurrently,
  this includes the C99 back-end and the SBV back-end.\n\nCopilot is a stream (i.e.,
  infinite lists) domain-specific language (DSL) in\nHaskell that compiles into embedded
  C.  Copilot is similar in spirit to\nlanguages like Lustre.  Copilot contains an
  interpreter, multiple back-end\ncompilers, and other verification tools.\n\nExamples\n=========\nPlease
  see the files under the Examples directory in the\n[Copilot](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot)
  for a number of examples\nshowing the syntax, use of libraries, and use of the interpreter
  and back-ends.\nThe examples is the best way to start.\n\nInstallation\n============\nThe
  Copilot library is cabalized. Assuming you have cabal and the GHC compiler\ninstalled
  (the [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) is the\neasiest way
  to obtain these), it should merely be a matter of running \n     \n         cabal
  install copilot-cbmc\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend you install Copilot, which
  installs copilot-c99\nand other packages automatically.  Execute\n\n         cabal
  install copilot\n\nDependencies\n=============\ncopilot-cbmc depends on the C model-checker,
  CBMC.\n[CBMC](http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) is a bounded model-checker for C code.
  \ We\nuse CBMC to prove that two back-ends generating C generate semantically\nequivalent
  C, to help detect bugs in C back-ends.\n\nResources\n=========\n[copilot-cbmc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-cbmc)
  is available on\nHackage.\n\n**Sources** for each package are available on Github
  as well.  Just go to\n[Github](github.com) and search for the package of interest.
