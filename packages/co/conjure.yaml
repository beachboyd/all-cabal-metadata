description: ! 'Conjure is a Bittorrent client written in the functional, pure, lazy

  language of Haskell. The primary point of Conjure is to show the

  feasibility of Haskell with respect to heavy network applications. In

  particular, we are using the STM (Software Transactional Memory)

  framework to provide us with concurrency.'
