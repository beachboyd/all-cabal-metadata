description: PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THIS AT THIS TIME. This library was for displaying
  a Conductive TempoClock in a separate terminal. Hackage says it does not build,
  and I have not been using it. This package is now empty, perhaps to return at a
  later date. It probably should have remained an experimental package on my website
  rather than appearing here in Hackage.
