description: ! 'Libraries such as binary and cereal support sequential reading and
  writing but do not rely on any further operations. Many media support seeking in
  files as well. This library implements a file format that supports random access
  to data entities by seeking. It is an attempt to improve and extend the applicability
  of the object graph serialization concept.


  This library enforces a strong concept of immutability in its interface; this has
  a number of benefits including sharing of substructure. Files in its format have
  a nominal mutable state that changes over discrete time steps, permitting strong
  reasoning. See Theory module for a basic equational theory. This work was inspired
  by Haskell''s focus on immutability, and by the programming langauge Clojure''s
  disciplined management of mutable state.


  The database''s store has been implemented over memory maps for speed, and is portable
  between Windows and Linux platforms. This library also uses the syb-with-class library
  to streamline implementation of serializers for various data entities, so that you
  don''t have to write much boilerplate ;).


  Release notes for version 0.1.1:


  * Changed the invariant surrounding how files are seeked for reading/writing procedures.
  This permits an additional optimization. See Utils module for details.


  * Generalized the interface to Utils locking strategies to arbitrary monads incorporating
  exceptions and I/O.


  Release notes for version 0.1.2:


  * Minor bug fixes.


  Release notes for version 0.1.3:


  * implemented additional functions specifically for handling dictionaries (''Map''s).


  * Added basic theory.'
