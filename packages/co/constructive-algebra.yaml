description: ! 'A library of algebra focusing mainly on commutative ring theory from
  a

  constructive point of view.


  Classical structures are implemented without Noetherian assumptions.

  This means that it is not assumed that all ideals are finitely

  generated. For example, instead of principal ideal domains one gets

  Bezout domains which are integral domains in which all finitely

  generated ideals are principal (and not necessarily that all ideals are

  principal). This give a good framework for implementing many

  interesting algorithms.'
