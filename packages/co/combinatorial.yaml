description: ! 'Counting, enumerating, ranking and unranking of combinatorial objects.

  Well-known and less well-known basic combinatoric problems and examples.


  The functions are not implemented in obviously stupid ways,

  but they are also not optimized to the maximum extent.

  The package is plain Haskell 98.

  Efficient computations of large combinatoric numbers.


  * @combinat@:

  Library for a similar purpose

  with a different structure and selection of problems.'
