  # Version 0.8.0.0

  ## Breaking API changes:

  - `Environment` concept has been introduced. This allows the user to specify an endpoint (production, sandbox)
    in which to query or stream.

      - `run` (and associated functions) now take an `Environment` as the first parameter. `runSandbox` and associated
        functions have been removed.
      - `runWithManager` now has different parameter ordering. Signature is `runWithManager :: Manager -> Environment -> ClientM a -> IO a`
      - `runCbAuthT` now takes a `Runner a`, where `Runner a = ClientM a -> IO a`; allows users to specify an environment in which to run

  - `placeOrder` now has `Maybe ClientOrderId` as the first parameter that allows users to assign `client_oid` to
    submitted orders. The `client_oid` field is visible on the `Full` channel.

  - `CoinbasePro.WebSocketFeed.subscribeToFeed` has two additional parameters:

      - `Environment`
      - `Maybe CoinbaseProCredentials`: allows users to authenticate on subscription. See `User`

  - Moved `UserId` and `ProfileId` to `CoinbasePro.Types` from `CoinbasePro.WebSocketFeed.Channel.Full.Activate`

  ## Additional Features:

  - Added `User` channel functionality that allows users to see `user_id` and `profile_id` on messages that pertain to the subscriber.
    See [documentation](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#the-user-channel) for more details

      - `user_id` and `profile_id` fields are now parsed from `Full` channel messages if available.

  - `CoinbasePro.Types.ClientOrderId` has been introduced to specify `client_oid` in `placeOrder` API request.
    - `client_oid` is now parsed from `CoinbasePro.WebSocketFeed.Channel.Full.Received.

  - `CoinbasePro.Authenticated.getOrder` allows users to query status of order

  - `CoinbasePro.Authenticated.getClientOrder` allows users to query status of order using `client_oid`


  ## Misc

  - minor cleanups of unused imports

  # Version 0.7.2.0
   - Upgraded to stack lts-14.17

  # Version 0.7.1.0
   - Fixed broken examples

  # Version 0.7.0.0
   - Unauthenticated requests are now all in the `ClientM` monad. `CoinbasePro.Request.run` is now required
     to operate in the IO monad.

     Example: `run (trades (ProductId "BTC-USD")) >>= print`

  - Added `run_`, `runSandbox`, `runSandboxWithManager` in `CoinbasePro.Request`
  - Added `currencies`, `fees`, and `trailingVolume` queries

  ```

  ### Authenticated Private Requests

  ```haskell
  runCbAuthT cpc $ do
      fills (Just btcusd) Nothing >>= liftIO . print
    where
      accessKey  = CBAccessKey "<access-key>"
