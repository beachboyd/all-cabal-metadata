  sure you include the following entry on your [cabal file's\ndependecies](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#build-information)\nsection.\n\n```cabal\nlibrary:\n
  \ build-depends: componentm\n```\n\nOr on your `package.yaml`\n\n```\ndependencies:\n-
  componentm\n```\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis library is intended to be a high level API
  for the\n[teardown](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/teardown) library; it provides
  a\nhigh level monad interface that helps composition of resource\nallocation/teardown
  in a safe and reliable way.\n\n### Differences with ResourceT\n\nThe [resourcet](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resourcet)
  library provides a\nmonad transformer that keeps track of allocated resources at
  runtime making sure\nthat if an exception happens or the block of execution finishes,
  the resources\nallocated are cleaned up.\n\nThe [componentm](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/componentm)
  library on the\nother hand, does not run as a Monad transformer, but rather it gets
  called at\nthe very beginning of your application, it builds the _environment_ needed
  by\nyour application environment to work (e.g. [Layer\n1](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/03/22/three_layer_haskell_cake.html)),
  and\nprovides helper _bracket style_ functions that cleanup all allocated resources\nin
  the right order when your application terminates either normally or with an\nerror.\n\n##

  library is intended to be minimal, providing a few functions that work\nreliably
  among many different kind of projects. If you want to contribute, Pull\nRequest
  are very welcome! Please try to follow these simple rules:\n\n* Please create a
  topic branch for every separate change you make.\n* Update the README.md file if
