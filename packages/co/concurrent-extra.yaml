description: ! "The `concurrent-extra` package offers among other things the following\nselection
  of synchronisation primitives:\n\n* `Broadcast`: Wake multiple threads by broadcasting
  a value.\n\n* `Event`: Wake multiple threads by signalling an event.\n\n* `Lock`:
  Enforce exclusive access to a resource. Also known as a\n  binary semaphore or mutex.
  The package additionally provides an\n  alternative that works in the `STM` monad.\n\n*
  `RLock`: A lock which can be acquired multiple times by the same\n  thread. Also
  known as a reentrant mutex.\n\n* `ReadWriteLock`: Multiple-reader, single-writer
  locks. Used to\n  protect shared resources which may be concurrently read, but only\n
  \ sequentially written.\n\n* `ReadWriteVar`: Concurrent read, sequential write variables.\n\nPlease
  consult the API documentation of the individual modules for\nmore detailed information.\n\nThis
  package was inspired by the concurrency libraries of\n[Java](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/concurrency/index.html)\nand
  [Python](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/threading.html).\n"
