description: |-
  This package generalizes familiar 'Functor', 'Foldable' and 'Traversable'
  for the case when a functorial type of kind Type -> Type imposes certain constraints
  on what can be put in. E.g. 'Set' can only deal with types that are an instance of 'Ord'
  and therefore cannot be made an instance of 'Functor'. But it can be made
  an instance of a constrained functor with a similar interface that this
  package provides.
