description: The laws of 'Eq' only require that you have a decidable equivalence relation
  defined on a type; they do not force you to guarantee abstraction with respect to
  the relation, i.e. you can write anti-extensional operations without violating the
  laws. This package provides an alternative for when functionality with respect to
  an equivalence relation is desired.
