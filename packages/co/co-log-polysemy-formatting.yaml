  # co-log-polysemy-formatting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AJChapman/co-log-polysemy-formatting.png)](https://travis-ci.org/AJChapman/co-log-polysemy-formatting) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/co-log-polysemy-formatting.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/co-log-polysemy-formatting)

  co-log-polysemy-formatting gives you a Polysemy logging effect for high quality (unstructured) logs.

  It does this by tying together several excellent packages:

  - [co-log],
  - [co-log-polysemy], and
  - [formatting].

  To get started, see [the haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/co-log-polysemy-formatting-0.1.0.0/docs/Colog-Polysemy-Formatting.html).

  ## Output format

  The output format is customisable, but by default it includes:

  - The message severity,
  - a message timestamp, with nanosecond accuracy,
  - a thread Id,
  - a source location, and
  - your log message, formatted using [formatting].

  ![example output](example/output.png)

  The colours show up if your terminal supports them, otherwise it will fall back to greyscale, including if you pipe the output to a file.

  ## formatting messages

  Our logging functions, e.g. `logInfo`, take a [formatting] formatter rather than a `String`/`Text`/etc.
  This makes it quick and easy to build your log messages from whatever type you have at hand, and still allows you to directly log string literals thanks to the `OverloadedStrings` language extension:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  myString :: String
  myString = "this is my string"

  myStrictText :: Data.Text.Text
  myStrictText = "this is my strict text"

  myLazyText :: Data.Text.Lazy.Text
  myLazyText = "this is my lazy text"

  -- These will all work:
  logInfo "a string literal"
  logInfo string myString
  logInfo stext myStrictText
  logInfo text myLazyText
  logInfo (string % ", " % stext % ", " % text) myString myStrictText myLazyText

  -- And logging structures is easy too:
  data Person = Person { personName :: Text, personAge :: Int }

  myPerson :: Person
  myPerson = Person "Dave" 16

  logInfo ("The person's name is " % accessed personName text <> ", and their age is " % accessed personAge int) myPerson

  -- Or with lenses
  data Person' = Person' { _personName :: Text, _personAge :: Int }
  makeLenses ''Person'

  myPerson' :: Person'
  myPerson' = Person' "Dave" 16

  logInfo ("The person's name is " % viewed personName text <> ", and their age is " % viewed personAge int) myPerson'
  ```

  ## Why not just use co-log-polysemy?

  [co-log-polysemy] is a generic logging effect that leaves many decisions up to you, such as your logging format and your logging message type.
  But if you want something that just works, with good defaults, then co-log-polysemy-formatting will get you there faster.
  And you're still using co-log-polysemy under the hood -- we even re-export some of its functions for you -- we've just added a few features on top.
