  # Revision history for r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-11-07

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-11-07

  * First version revised A. Dependency boundaries changed.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2020-11-07

  * First version revised B. Fixed issue with being not compiled for the GHC-7.8* series of compiler.

  ## 0.1.3.0 -- 2020-11-09

  * First version revised C. Some code improvements. Some documentation improvements.

  ## 0.1.4.0 -- 2020-11-10

  * First version revised D. Added printing for the ready inner in the getBFst' function tuple. Fixed issue with inexact documentation. Added lists-flines as
  a new leightweight dependency. Improved printing system for various OSes.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-11-10

  * Second version. Added a new function answer2 that allows to change the randomization boundaries for the model (this allows, e. g. to research accents). Added the possibility to
  specify up to 4 randomization boundaries as the 4 first command line arguments (otherwise, the default values are used). Please, be aware of possible violating the dependencies
  between durations of the sounds because of inappropriately chosen randomization parameters (sometimes the dependencies can violate also for the appropriately chosen durations
  though it less common in such a case).

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2020-11-10

  * Second version revised A. Made narrower the default possible randomization parameters (now, the default behaviour is like for 0.1.4.0 version).

  ## 0.2.2.0 -- 2020-12-03

  * Second version revised B. Extended the README.md with some basic examples of the pldUkr usage.

description: "The library and the executable is intended to use the functionality
  of the :\n\n1) R programming language https://www.r-project.org/\n\n2) Rglpk library
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rglpk/index.html\n\n3) GNU GLPK library
  https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html\n\nFor more information, please, see
  the documentation for them.\n\n* Some examples.\n\nLet in the file words.txt you
  have the Ukrainian words and their durations in seconds as pairs separated with
  whitespace \nat the lines. \n\nThen the following commands can be variants of the
  usage of the pldUkr executable. \n\n1) pldUkr 0.01 0.01 0.1 0.2 words.txt 1.8 -1
  0.01 0.01 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nTHis variant tries to
  minimize the duration of the soft sign (-1 as the second parameter after the file
  name), tries \nto reduce the influence of the volatile 'X' and 'Y' (the third and
  the fourth parameters as 0.01) and tries to somewhat \nmake longer the 6 Ukrainian
  vowels (all the consonants have by that the default coefficients equal to 1.0).\n\n2)
  pldUkr 0.01 0.01 0.1 0.2 words.txt 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R
  --quiet --no-save \n\nThe same as the 1), but with more prolongation of the vowels.\n\n3)
  pldUkr 0.01 0.01 0.1 0.2 words.txt 1.4 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R
  --quiet --no-save \n\nIf the 2) gives you the not NULL result, then it is recommended
  to minimize the first parameter after the file name. \n\n4) pldUkr 0.01 0.01 0.1
  0.2 words.txt 1.6 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nIf
  the previous gives NULL result, then try to somewhat increase the first parameter
  after the file name.\n\nIt is needed to be said that after the vowel sounds there
  are the coefficients for the voiced and, afterwards, for the \nvoiceless sounds.
  If omitted, they are equal to the default 1.0.\n"
