changelog: "# Revision history for r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations\n\n##
  0.1.0.0 -- 2020-11-07\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n##
  0.1.1.0 -- 2020-11-07\n\n* First version revised A. Dependency boundaries changed.\n\n##
  0.1.2.0 -- 2020-11-07\n\n* First version revised B. Fixed issue with being not compiled
  for the GHC-7.8* series of compiler.\n\n## 0.1.3.0 -- 2020-11-09\n\n* First version
  revised C. Some code improvements. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.1.4.0
  -- 2020-11-10\n\n* First version revised D. Added printing for the ready inner in
  the getBFst' function tuple. Fixed issue with inexact documentation. Added lists-flines
  as\na new leightweight dependency. Improved printing system for various OSes.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2020-11-10\n\n* Second version. Added a new function answer2 that allows
  to change the randomization boundaries for the model (this allows, e. g. to research
  accents). Added the possibility to \nspecify up to 4 randomization boundaries as
  the 4 first command line arguments (otherwise, the default values are used). Please,
  be aware of possible violating the dependencies \nbetween durations of the sounds
  because of inappropriately chosen randomization parameters (sometimes the dependencies
  can violate also for the appropriately chosen durations \nthough it less common
  in such a case). \n\n"
