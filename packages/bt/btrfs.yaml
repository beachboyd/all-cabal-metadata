description: ! 'This package provides bindings to the low-level btrfs API (i.e. the

  @BTRFS_IOC_@* @ioctl@s). Currently, only a subset of the API is

  supported, including all functions needed to work with subvolumes/snapshots

  as well as file cloning.


  In order to build this package, @linux-headers@ needs to be installed.


  Warning: btrfs is still considered experimental. This module is also

  experimental and may contain serious bugs that may result in data loss.

  Do not use it on data that has not been backed up yet.'
