description: TGA is a very simple format (like Bitmap), but in contrast to Bitmap
  also stores an alpha channel for transparency. Although tga might be outdated it
  had to be implemented because stb-image only supports reading. This version supports
  raw RGB24 and RGB32 data without palettes or run length encoding
