synopsis: An account authentication plugin for Yesod
changelog: ! "# Fork: 1.0\n\n* Changed into an official fork after being an unofficial
  one for\n  a long time.  An e-mail was sent about this fork to John Lenz\n  on 2015-05-08,
  but as of 2015-06-01 no reply has been received.\n\n* Moved to a Git repo on GitHub.\n\n\n#
  1.4.0\n\n* Add proper support for i18n:\n    * Moved messages into Yesod.Auth.Account.Message
  module\n    * Added renderAccountMessage function to YesodAuthAccount class, which
  defaults to\n      the english messages.\n    * resendVerifyEmailWidget, resetPasswordWidget,
  newAccountForm, resetPasswordForm, and\n      runAccountPersistDB had their context's
  updated with a constraint for\n      `YesodAuthAccount db master`, which shouldn't
  be a problem.\n\n* Use the nonce package for generating the keys sent in the verification
  and reset\n  password emails.  The `nonce` package provides efficient and cryptographically
  secure\n  nonces.\n\n* Support yesod 1.4 and persistent 2.1 (also bump our version
  to 1.4 to match yesod)\n"

description: ! "This package provides a [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/) authentication
  plugin for accounts. Each\naccount consists of an username, email, and password.
  \ When initially creating an account, the email\nis verified by sending a link in
  an email.  The plugin also supports password reset via email.\n\nThe plugin provides
  default pages implementing all of this functionality, but it has been designed\nto
  allow all the pages (new account page, password reset, etc.) to be customized or
  for the forms to\nbe embedded into your own pages allowing you to just ignore the
  routes inside the plugin.  The\ndetails are contained in the [haddock\ndocumentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-auth-account-fork).\n\nThe
  plugin supports any form data storage by requiring you to implement a couple of
  interfaces for\ndata access.  The plugin has instances of these interfaces using
  persistent, but you can create your\nown implementation if you are not using persistent
  or want more control over user data access and\nstorage.\n\nA complete working example
  using persistent is\n`example.hs`.  Also, see the\n[haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-auth-account-fork).\n\n#
  Fork\n\nThis is a fork of the `yesod-auth-account` package with the\nfollowing additions:\n\n
  \ * Login using either username or e-mail.\n\n  * JSON support for single page applications.\n\nWe'd
  like to merge these changes back upstream but its\nmaintainer has been unresponsive.\n"
