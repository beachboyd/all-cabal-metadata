synopsis: Fast, pure and practical SHA-512 implementation
changelog: ! "## 0.11.100.1\n\n - First public release\n\n## 0.11.100.0 *(unreleased)*\n\n
  - new `hmac` and `hmaclazy` functions providing HMAC-SHA-512\n   computation conforming
  to RFC2104 and RFC4231\n - fix unaligned memory-accesses\n - switch to 'safe' FFI
  for calls where overhead becomes neglible\n - removed inline assembly in favour
  of portable C constructs\n - fix 32bit length overflow bug in `hash` function\n
  - fix inaccurate context-size\n - add context-size verification to incremental API
  operations\n\n## 0.11.7.1 *(unreleased)*\n\n - first version forked off `cryptohash-0.11.7`
  release\n"

description: ! 'A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 SHA-512 hash algorithm>

  (including <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC HMAC> support)

  with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.


  The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C implementation.


  NOTE: This package has been forked off @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@
  package has been

  deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for a lightweight package

  providing the SHA512 hash algorithm without any dependencies on packages other than

  @base@ and @bytestring@.


  Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash@''s

  "Crypto.Hash.SHA512" module, though with a clearly smaller footprint.'
