synopsis: Criterion measurement functionality and associated types
changelog: ! "0.1.1.0\n\n* Add `nfAppIO` and `whnfAppIO` functions, which take a function
  and its\n  argument separately like `nf`/`whnf`, but whose function returns `IO`
  like\n  `nfIO`/`whnfIO`. This is useful for benchmarking functions in which the
  bulk\n  of the work is not bound by IO, but by pure computations that might otherwise\n
  \ be optimized away if the argument is known statically.\n\n0.1.0.0\n\n* This is
  the first release of `criterion-measurement`. The changelog notes\n  below are copied
  from the notes for the corresponding `criterion` release,\n  `criterion-1.5.0.0`.\n\n*
  Move the measurement functionality of `criterion` into a standalone package,\n  `criterion-measurement`.
  In particular, `cbits/` and `Criterion.Measurement`\n  are now in `criterion-measurement`,
  along with the relevant definitions of\n  `Criterion.Types` and `Criterion.Types.Internal`
  (both of which are now under\n  the `Criterion.Measurement.*` namespace).\n  Consequently,
  `criterion` now depends on `criterion-measurement`.\n\n  This will let other libraries
  (e.g. alternative statistical analysis\n  front-ends) to import the measurement
  functionality alone as a lightweight\n  dependency.\n\n* Fix a bug on macOS and
  Windows where using `runAndAnalyse` and other\n  lower-level benchmarking functions
  would result in an infinite loop.\n"

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bos/criterion.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bos/criterion)


  Measurement-related functionality extracted from Criterion, with minimal dependencies.
  The rationale for this is to enable alternative analysis front-ends.
