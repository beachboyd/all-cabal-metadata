synopsis: Criterion measurement functionality and associated types
changelog: |
  0.1.2.0

  * Ensure that `Criterion.Measurement.Types.Internal` is always compiled with
    optimizations, even if the `criterion-measurement` library itself happens to
    be built with `-O0` or `-fprof-auto`. This is necessary to ensure that the
    inner benchmarking loop of criterion always finishes in a timely manner,
    even if the rest of the library is not fully optimized.

  0.1.1.0

  * Add `nfAppIO` and `whnfAppIO` functions, which take a function and its
    argument separately like `nf`/`whnf`, but whose function returns `IO` like
    `nfIO`/`whnfIO`. This is useful for benchmarking functions in which the bulk
    of the work is not bound by IO, but by pure computations that might otherwise
    be optimized away if the argument is known statically.

  0.1.0.0

  * This is the first release of `criterion-measurement`. The changelog notes
    below are copied from the notes for the corresponding `criterion` release,
    `criterion-1.5.0.0`.

  * Move the measurement functionality of `criterion` into a standalone package,
    `criterion-measurement`. In particular, `cbits/` and `Criterion.Measurement`
    are now in `criterion-measurement`, along with the relevant definitions of
    `Criterion.Types` and `Criterion.Types.Internal` (both of which are now under
    the `Criterion.Measurement.*` namespace).
    Consequently, `criterion` now depends on `criterion-measurement`.

    This will let other libraries (e.g. alternative statistical analysis
    front-ends) to import the measurement functionality alone as a lightweight
    dependency.

  * Fix a bug on macOS and Windows where using `runAndAnalyse` and other
    lower-level benchmarking functions would result in an infinite loop.

  # criterion-measurement

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bos/criterion.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bos/criterion)

  Measurement-related functionality extracted from Criterion, with minimal dependencies. The rationale for this is to enable alternative analysis front-ends.
