description: ! 'The library provides efficient implementation of the first-order,

  linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs).


  Important feature of the implemented flavour of CRFs is that transition

  features which are not included in the CRF model are considered to have

  probability of 0.

  It is particularly useful when the training material determines the set

  of possible label transitions (e.g. when using the IOB encoding method).

  Furthermore, this design decision makes the implementation much faster

  for sparse datasets.'
