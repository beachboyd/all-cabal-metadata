description: ! 'The library provides efficient implementation of the first-order,

  linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) with position-wise

  constraints imposed over label values.


  It is strongly related to the simpler

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/crf-chain1>

  library where constraints are not taken into account and all features

  which are not included in the CRF model are considered to have

  probability of 0.  Here, on the other hand, such features do not

  influence the overall probability of the (sentence, labels) pair

  - they are assigned the default potential of 0.


  Efficient algorithm for determining marginal probabilities of individual

  labels is provided.

  The tagging is performed with respect to marginal probabilities.'
