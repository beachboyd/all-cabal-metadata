synopsis: Library and binary to generate sequence/flow diagrams from plain text source
changelog: ! "tagged 0.7\n\n  * Added Order directive (see sample.flow for usage)\n
  \ * Fix: identifier could not be empty\n  * Removing useles import\n  * Preserve
  UTF8 chars in \"reflow\"\n  * Fix to preserve UTF8 chars in \"showDot\" (again)\n
  \ * Imported Dot.hs from dotgen 0.4.1\n  * Fixed \"lost edge\" errors from graphviz\n\ntagged
  0.6.1\n\n  * Forgot to add Text.Dot local override to cabal. Thnx to dons for spotting
  it\n\ntagged 0.6\n\n  * Fixed repo URL in README\n  * Made sources compilable with
  QuickCheck2\n  * Dotgen kills UTF-8 in graph attributes. Incorporated patched version
  of dotgen-0.2 into flow2dot until it will be fixed upstream\n  * Added quickCheck.hs
  and rebuild.sh\n\ntagged 0.5.1\n\n  * Moved all flow diagram processing to separate
  module (exposed from this package)\n\ntagged 0.4\n  * Documentation fixes\n  * Switched
  to `dotgen` package for all graphviz generation needs.\n\t    Dropped support of
  preformatted strings in flow files.\n\ntagged 0.3.1\n  * Fixed links to repo and
  docs\n\ntagged 0.3\n  * Ditched Text.UTF8 in favor of utf8-string library\n  * Quotes
  inside messages are now properly escaped for Dot. Sample updated accordingly.\n\ntagged
  0.2.1\n  * Version bump to 0.2.1 - ready for GHC 6.8.2\n  * -Wall\n  * +LANGUAGE
  pragmas\n\ntagged 0.2\n  * Some minor clarifications in docs\n  * Dropped regex-based
  parser in favor of parsec-based due to issues with Unicode\n  * Added QuickCheck
  to cabal, added LICENSE to Dot.hs\n  * Added QuickCheck for Flow parser/pretty-printer\n
  \ * Moved graph generation into separate module\n  * Added UTF8 module\n  * cabalization\n\ntagged
  0.1\n  * initial version\n"

description: ! "This is a tool to generate nice sequence (flow) diagrams from\ntextual
  descriptions, written in Haskell.\n\nThis tool generates a diagram _description_,
  which could be made into\na nice picture with help of Graphviz (www.graphviz.org)\n\nTo
  try it out, run:\n  runhaskell flow2dot.hs sample.flow | dot -T png -o sample.png\nand
  view \"sample.png\" with your favorite picture viewer. If you\ndont get a nice picture
  and get something else (for example, ugly\nsegfault from dot), try upgrading to
  latest Graphviz (2.12 or later)\n\nIf you want to use national alphabets, make sure
  that your .flow files\nare encoded in UTF-8. If you want to tweak the output - read
  Dot manual\nand use it for scaling, colors, pagination etc.\n\nLatest version could
  be obtained via:\n  darcs pull http://adept.linux.kiev.ua:8080/repos/flow2dot/\n\nLicense
  \    :  BSD-style (see the file LICENSE)\nSend patches to dastapov@gmail.com (using
  \"darcs send\")\n\nThanks to Cale, quicksilver and roconnor from #haskell for\nsuggestions
  on how to modularize this. Thanks to Dema from\nhaskell@conference.jabber.ru for
  win32 testing. Gwern0 helped\nto adapt this to GHC 6.8.2. Radoslav Dorcik sent in
  parser improvements.\nMike Shigorin and Denis Smirnov packaged for Alt Linux and
  provided feedback\non compatibility with different GHC versions. Vasyl Vaskul reported
  bugs.\n\nKnown issues\n============\n\n* Dot < 2.12 will most likely segfault on
  files generated by flow2dot\n\n* If your version of dot complains about \"Error:
  lost n1 n2 edge\", try using\nflow2dot-fix-dot-lost-edges in place of dot:\n\n   runhaskell
  flow2dot your.flow | flow2dot-fix-dot-lost-edges -T png -o your.png\n\nTrick is
  to remove 'constraint=\"false\"' from all edges that dot reports as lost.\n\n"
