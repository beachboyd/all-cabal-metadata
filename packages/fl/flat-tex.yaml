  ========


  The use case for this tool is:

  your paper has been accepted at a conference, and now you have

  to submit the latex sources for inclusion in the proceedings.


  But - your sources contain some information that you don''t want

  to reveal. E.g., it contains  `\todo{fix proof of previous theorem}`.


  flat-tex does the following:

  * flatten a multi-file latex document (recursively expanding all `\input`)

  * remove all `\todo{..}`, `\reminder{..}` and comments (`% ...`)


  How `\input{foo}` is expanded:

  * if the file `foo` does exist, then it is processed

  * else `foo.tex` is processed
