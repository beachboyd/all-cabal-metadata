  * fltkhs-themes

  `fltkhs-themes` tries to make it easy to write nice consistent-looking

  [FLTKHS](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs-0.5.4.5/docs/Graphics-UI-FLTK-LowLevel-FLTKHS.html)

  applications by providing drop-in light themed replacement widgets to the

  standard ones with minimal performance and memory overhead.


  Please see the [Hackage

  docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs-themes/docs/Graphics-UI-FLTK-Theme-Light.html)
  for much more information on installation and getting started with this package.


  * Screenshots

  There is a small but growing [showcase

  app](https://github.com/deech/fltkhs-themes-demo) with screenshots that gives a

  better idea of look-and-feel.
