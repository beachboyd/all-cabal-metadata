synopsis: Work generically on your datatype without knowing its shape nor its contents.
changelog: ! "# Version 0.3\n\n* `zip`, `zip1` and `unsafeZip` now take a monadic
  pairing function, and return\n  `Maybe` where `Nothing` happens in the target indexes
  do not match.\n\n* Added `trivialize`.\n\n* Generalized type of `trivial'`.\n\n*
  Remove `Record` and `GRecord`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: The `m`
  parameter in in `Flay` and `Flayable` has been\n  existentialized, to be chosen
  by the caller.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: We don't use `DefaultSignatures` for `flay
  = gflay` anymore.\n  This is very sad, but unfortunately type inferrence for the
  `c` type variable\n  in new `Flayable` instances doesn't work.\n\n* Added `Flayable1`,
  `trivial1`, `collect1`, `Terminal`, `GTerminal`, `zip1`,\n  `zip`, `Record`, `GRecord`.\n\n*
  Removed `outer`.\n\n* Made compatible with GHC 8.2.2.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n* Initial
  version.\n"
