changelog: ! "# Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: The `m` parameter in in `Flay` and
  `Flayable` has been\n  existentialized, to be chosen by the caller.\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: We don't use `DefaultSignatures` for `flay = gflay` anymore.\n  This is
  very sad, but unfortunately type inferrence for the `c` type variable\n  in new
  `Flayable` instances doesn't work.\n\n* Added `Flayable1`, `trivial1`, `collect1`,
  `Terminal`, `GTerminal`, `zip1`,\n  `zip`, `Record`, `GRecord`.\n\n* Removed `outer`.\n\n*
  Made compatible with GHC 8.2.2.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n* Initial version.\n"
