  ===============


  This package is useful to convert to and from, types and data structure commonly
  found in

  the haskell ecosystem.


  For now, edge support the following packages:


  * bytestring (initial)

  * text (initial)


  And planning to add support to:


  * vector


  If you think edge would benefits from other packages, open an issue (or even better
  a PR) with

  suggestion of what to add.
