changelog: |
  ### 0.4.0 (August 29, 2019)

  * ModGraph: parse Fortran files and assemble them into a dependency graph in order to construct automated 'build' plans for analysis and summarisation (e.g. with --make-mods option).
  * Change name of compilation to summarisation. Remains as '-c' option.
  * Allow multiple files and directories to be specified on command line.
  * Search includedir recursively for fsmod files.
  * Change format of fsmod-files so that they can contain [ModFile] since multiple Fortran files can be summarised into a single mod file.
  * Introduce strictness and NFData dependencies across the board.
  * Use Pipes to process large amounts of files in order to control memory usage and more efficiently process things.
  * Parsing rules for StructStructures (thanks Raoul Charman)

  ### 0.3.0 (June 13, 2019)

  * Add partial Fortran2003 support.
  * Introduce datatype for BBGr instead of prior type alias for Gr.
    * Now split into three fields: bbgrGr, bbgrEntries and bbgrExits
    * May require refactoring of code to use bbgrGr field where a Gr was expected before.
  * Introduce pragmaOffset field for Position, allowing pragmas to specify an apparent file and line-number.
    * May require refactoring of code that uses the Position constructor.
    * Fifth field is Maybe (Int, String), containing a line-offset and a target filename when present.
    * It's designed such that most Position-based transformations are not affected by the pragmaOffset.
    * They may need to preserve the field, though, as it passes through functions.
    * Default value is 'Nothing'.
  * Add --show-flows-to/--show-flows-from features
    * Visualise the dataflow use/def chains using GraphViz.
  * Add --show-block-numbers feature.
    * Allows user to get AST-block numbers easily in order to use them with the above visualisation features.
  * Fix several bugs with dataflow analysis that had accumulated.
  * Eliminate StContinue and StEnddo are eliminated during GroupLabeledDo transformations.
    * To be consistent with unlabeled Do.
  * Parse and discard C-comments as a convenience feature for when fortran-src must interact with the output of C preprocessors that insert spurious comments.
  * Add type propagation into type analysis, annotating every expression with a type.
    * Additional interface: analyseTypesWithEnv to access a list of type errors found.
  * Add dimensional information to CTArray and length/kind to TypeCharacter.
  * Stricter checking of the grouping transform - if any statements that should be grouped are not grouped, raise an error.
  * Support pragmas that alter the current 'filename and position' tracker, often used by preprocessors to help pinpoint original code locations.
    * Uses a relative offset field called 'posPragmaOffset' so that relative measures continue to function correctly.
  * Add constant propagation / parameter variable analysis.
  * Add -c feature to compile 'fsmod files' with renaming and type info.

  ### 0.2.1.1 (May 18, 2018)

  * Extend Fortran 95 support
  * Extend support for legacy extensions

  ### 0.2.1.1 (December 13, 2017)

  * Fortran95Experimental module renamed to Fortran95
  * No infinite loops due to symlinks.
  * Fortran 95 support.
    * AST extended to support more non-standard statements internally.
