description: ! 'Fountain codes are forward error correction codes for erasure channels.

  They are able to recover lost packets without needing a backchannel.

  As a rateless code, transmitters generate packets at random, on the fly.

  Receivers then listen to as many packets as needed to reconstruct the message.'
