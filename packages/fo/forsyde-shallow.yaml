description: ! " ForSyDe's Haskell-embedded Domain Specific Language.\n ====================================================\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n
  The ForSyDe (Formal System Design) methodology has been developed\n with the objective
  to move system design to a higher level of\n abstraction and to bridge the abstraction
  gap by transformational\n design refinement.\n \n This library provides ForSyDe's
  implementation as a Haskell-embedded\n Domain Specific Language (DSL). \n\n For
  more information, please see ForSyDe's website:\n <http://forsyde.ict.kth.se/>.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n
  For information on how to install ForSyDe see the INSTALL file.\n"
