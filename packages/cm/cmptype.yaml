  ## Overview

  `cmptype` provides a magical type family that lets you compare types:

  ```haskell
  type family CmpType (a :: k) (b :: k) :: Ordering
  ```

  When you turn on the `-fplugin=Type.Compare.Plugin` flag, it will let you
  compare arbitrary types. Why would you want such a thing? Probably because you
  want to write a [type-level container that isn't a fucking list][type-sets]!

  ## Acknowledgments

  Big thanks to [Boris Rozinov][oofp] for the initial idea, and for making as much
  coffee as I could drink while I wrote it. Also thanks to [Christiaan
  Baaij][chistiaanb] and [Matt Pickering][mpickering] for their indispensable help
  convincing GHC to do the right thing here.
