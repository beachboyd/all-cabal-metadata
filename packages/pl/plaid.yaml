description: "![](https://plaid.com/assets/img/navbar/logo.svg) \n\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/v0d1ch/plaid.png)](https://travis-ci.org/v0d1ch/plaid)\n\n\nThis
  is a Haskell library for interacting with [plaid.com](https://plaid.com) api.\n\nIt
  utilizes some of the nice ideas presented in the [GDP](https://kataskeue.com/gdp.pdf)
  paper and in general tries to stay out of your way and let you issue plaid.com api
  calls easily.\n\nYou should check out the [/examples/Main.hs](https://github.com/v0d1ch/plaid/blob/master/examples/Main.hs)
  to see some of the examples of using\nthe lib.\n\n#### Contributing\n\n\nI encourage
  you to play with the library, open up issues, get yourself involved.\n\nPlan is
  to build nice documentation with helpful examples.\n\nI don't have specific code
  style guidelines, just follow the code style that you\nalready see. \n\nThere is
  a stylish-haskell.yaml file in the root and it would be nice if you can configure
  your editor to use it.\n\nPlease squash your commits into one when issuing a PR
  so we keep a nice git timeline.\n\n\n\n"
