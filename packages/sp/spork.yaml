  Takes an error-throwing expression and puts it back in the Maybe/Either it belongs in.

  This package is a fork of <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/spoon spoon>.

  Note that this currently suffers from the
  <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5902 asynchronous exceptions re-thrown synchronously>
  problem. Buyer beware.
