description: ! '/WARNING/: This package is /unstable/, do not use

  except for testing.


  A general sequence representation with arbitary

  annotations, for use as a base for implementations

  of various collection types.


  The splay operation in this package is implemented

  using a top-down approach.


  Some parts of the documentation are based on those

  in the @containers@ and @fingertree@ package.'
