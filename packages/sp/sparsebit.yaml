description: ! "Sparse Bitmaps for Pattern Match Coverage\n\nAbstract:\n  Pattern
  matching coverage over Algebraic Data Types(ADTs) has most often been studied in
  the context of pattern compilation algorithms. However, it is worth considering
  the pattern matching coverage problem in isolation, since general solutions will
  be independent of the specifics of any implementation or language.\n  We define
  an intuitive and mathematically well-established bit masking semantics for pattern
  match coverage. We design and implement a sparse bitmap data structure, which realizes
  this semantics in a compact and flexible manner. This bitmap data structure supports
  computing coverage solutions of large programs incrementally from coverage solutions
  of sub-programs. It can also be used as a common data representation for pattern
  coverage shared between different tools (e.g., compilers, linting tools, software
  analysis tools) that need pattern match coverage information.\n\n\nYou can see further
  details in the paper and the talk slides on the this URL:\n  http://kyagrd.dyndns.org/wiki/SparseBitmapsForPatternMatchCoverage\n\n\nAdditional
  source files Type.hs and TestType.hs packaged with this library\nprovides the examples
  and QuickCheck extracted from the paper to demonstrate\nhow to use this library.\n\n"
