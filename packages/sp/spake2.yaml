synopsis: Implementation of the SPAKE2 Password-Authenticated Key Exchange algorithm
changelog: ! "# Changelog\n\n## 0.4.1 (2018-01-17)\n\n* Fixed potential security issue
  in `Ed25519` (see https://github.com/jml/haskell-spake2/pull/16),\n  present since
  initial release. Please update as soon as possible.\n\n## 0.4.0 (2017-11-22)\n\n*
  Change `createSessionKey` inputs to be `inbound`, `outbound` rather than\n  `side
  A`, `side B`. If you were passing as `side A`, `side B` before, it\n  should continue
  to work, unless you were deliberately triggering an error\n  condition.\n* Add `spake2Exchange`,
  for much more convenient exchanges.\n\n## 0.3.0 (2017-11-11)\n\n* Depend on protolude
  0.2 minimum\n\n## 0.2.0 (2017-06-08)\n\n* `Group` typeclass split into `Group` and
  `AbelianGroup` typeclasses\n\n## 0.1.0 (2017-05-28)\n\nInitial release\n"

description: ! 'This library implements the SPAKE2 password-authenticated key exchange

  ("PAKE") algorithm. This allows two parties, who share a weak password, to

  safely derive a strong shared secret (and therefore build an

  encrypted+authenticated channel).'
