description: ! 'These are the modules for applicative functors and friends,

  as found in GHC-6.6 and higher.

  We provide them for use in versions up to GHC-6.4.

  This package can be used for backward compatibility.



  ToDo:


  Add various instances of Foldable and Traversable for base types like Map,

  but these will be less efficient as you don''t have access to their implementations.
