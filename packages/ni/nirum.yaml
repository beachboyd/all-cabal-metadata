changelog: ! "Nirum changelog\n===============\n\nVersion 0.3.0\n-------------\n\nReleased
  on February 18, 2018.\n\n### Language\n\n -  [Package](./docs/package.md) is now
  a new compilation unit of Nirum.\n    Every Nirum package needs *package.toml* manifest
  file.\n    [[#83], [#99]]\n -  Since a Nirum package can be compiled to more than
  one target languages,\n    the `nirum` command became to have `-t`/`--target` required
  parameter.\n    [[#106], [#111], [#114]]\n -  Added `-w`/`--watch` mode.  [[#91],
  [#104], [#218]]\n -  Annotations became able to have multiple arguments and every
  parameter\n    became necessary to having its name (keyword).  [[#178], [#190],
  [#197]]\n -  Service methods became able to omit their return types.\n    [[#179],
  [#199] by Yang Chun Ung]\n -  Added `@error` annotation to make a type to subclass
  an exception base\n    class (e.g., [`Exception`][python-exception] in Python) when
  it's compiled\n    to OO languages.  [[#38], [#127]]\n -  Union tag docstrings in
  parentheses became allowed.  [[#153], [#154]]\n -  Fixed a parser bug that a bare
  identifier (i.e., unquoted identifier) cannot\n    start with a reserved keyword,
  e.g., `types` (`type` is reserved),\n    `enumeration` (`enum` is reserved).  [[#184],
  [#189]]\n -  Fixed a parser bug that `import` names had been disallowing to have\n
  \   a trailing comma or newlines.  [[#202]]\n -  Fixed the `nirum` command bug that
  it had always terminated with exit code\n    0 even when it errored.  [[#97], [#108]]\n\n###
  Docs target\n\n -  A new target, `docs` is now available.  To generate docs for
  a Nirum\n    package, specify `--target docs` option to the `nirum` command.\n    [[#10],
  [#113], [#116], [#125], [#131], [#152], [#170], [#223]]\n\n### Python target\n\n
  -  Now supports Python 2.7 besides Python 3.4 or later.\n    [[#50], [#85], [#93],
  [#117], [nirum-python #22]]\n -  Now requires *nirum-python* 0.6.0 or later.  [[#119],
  [#141], [#146]]\n -  From now on, in order to compile a Nirum package to Python,\n
  \   *package.toml* manifest need [`targets.python`][targets.python] section\n    and
  `targets.python.name` field.  [[#99]]\n -  Added `targets.python.minimum_runtime`
  option to specify the minimum\n    version of *nirum-python* runtime library.  [[#118],
  [#119]]\n -  Added `targets.python.renames` option to rename module names when they\n
  \   are compiled to a Python module.  [[#121]]\n -  More package metadata became
  configurable.  [[#100]]\n     -  `targets.python.description`  [[#174] by Seunghun
  Lee]\n     -  `targets.python.license`  [[#180] by Seunghun Lee]\n     -  `targets.python.keywords`
  \ [[#183] by Seunghun Lee]\n -  Added new transport layer.  [[#149], [nirum-python
  #79], [nirum-python #92]]\n     -  Generated constructors of service clients became
  to take a\n        `nirum.transport.Transport` instance.\n     -  Followed renamed/moved
  import paths of the runtime classes\n        (e.g., `nirum.rpc.Service` became to
  `nirum.service.Service`).\n     -  The way to avoid name collision between generated
  types and runtime\n        classes is changed.  The runtime library had provided
  alternative names\n        like `service_type` for `Service` and generated imports
  had been like\n        `from nirum.rpc import service_type`, but it's now\n        `from
  nirum.service import Service as service_type`.\n -  Record/union tag fields of an
  optional type can be omitted when\n    the constructor is called.\n    [[#70], [#165]
  by Seunghun Lee]\n -  Generated tag classes became qualified under its union class\n
  \   (e.g., `Shape.Rectangle` instead of `Rectangle`).\n    Deprecated the old style
  and it is going to be obsolete in the near future.\n    [[#68], [#193]]\n -  Generated
  service clients became qualified under its service class\n    (e.g., `FooService.Client`
  instead of `FooService_Client`).\n    Deprecated the old style and it is going to
  be obsolete in the near future.\n    [[#167], [#222]].\n -  Generated serializers
  became independent from *nirum-python* runtime\n    library.  [[#160], [#201], [#203],
  [#204]]\n -  Deserializers became to show multiple error messages at a time.\n    [[#168],
  [#224]]\n -  Generated Python classes became having `__nirum_type__` metadata for
  RTTI.\n    [[nirum-python #34], [#192]]\n -  Generated service classes became having
  `__nirum_method_annotations__`\n    metadata for processing annotations.  [[#194]]\n
  -  Docstrings in a Nirum schema became to generate corresponding Python\n    docstrings.
  \ [[#102], [#128]]\n -  Sets, lists, and maps became compiled to immutable data
  structures\n    so that thay are easily hashable.  [[nirum-python #49], [#123]]\n
  -  Fixed a bug that implicit ancestor packages hadn't been generated even\n    if
  they have submodules.  [[#92], [#105]]\n -  Fixed a bug that a generated Python
  code had raised\n    [`NameError`][python-name-error] when a referring type is above
  than\n    a referred type.  [[#138], [nirum-python #88], [#146]]\n -  Fixed a bug
  that a generated Python `enum` code had became broken\n    when an enum type has
  a member named `mro`.  [[#185], [#188]]\n\n### Et cetera\n\n -  The officialy distributed
  executable binaries for Linux became\n    independent from [glibc]; instead statically
  linked to [musl].  [#216]\n -  The Docker image now has `nirum` command in `PATH`.
  \ [[#155]]\n -  The Docker image became based and built on [Alpine Linux][] so that\n
  \   the image is now much lighter.\n\n[#10]: https://github.com/spoqa/nirum/issues/10\n[#38]:

  0.2.0\n-------------\n\nStill unstable release.  Released on September 26, 2016.\n\n###
  Language\n\n -  The `boxed` keyword was renamed to `unboxed`.  [[#65], [#81]]\n
  -  [Annotations](./docs/annotation.md) became renewed and complete\n    so that
  every type and module now can be annotated.\n    [[#40], [#73]]\n -  Docstrings
  became merely a syntactic sugar of `@docs` annotation.\n    [[#53], [#57]]\n -  Fixed
  a parser bug which had failed to parse spaces right before/after tag\n    parentheses.
  \ [[#69], [#71]]\n -  Fixed a parser bug which had referred to a wrong line/column
  position on\n    syntax error message when a trailing semicolon is missing.  [[#64]]\n\n[#40]:

  is an [IDL][1] compiler and [RPC][2]/[distributed object][3] framework\nfor [microservices][4],
  built on top of the modern Web server technologies\nsuch as RESTful HTTP and JSON.\n\nYou
  can find how the language looks like from source codes in the `examples/`\ndirectory.\n\n**Note
  that its design is highly unstable and could be changed.**\nAlso the feature set
  is incomplete yet.\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language\n[2]:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices\n\n\nNightly builds\n--------------\n\nThe
  easiest way to give a try to use Nirum is downloading a nightly build.\nWe currently
  provides the prebuilt binaries of the following platforms:\n\n- [Linux (x86_64)](https://nightly-builds.nirum.org/travis-builds/nirum-linux-x86_64)\n-
  [Mac (x86_64)](https://nightly-builds.nirum.org/travis-builds/nirum-darwin-x86_64)\n-
  [Windows (x64)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/dahlia/nirum-k5n5y/artifacts/nirum-win-x64.exe?job=Platform%3A%20x64&branch=master)\n-
  [Windows (x86)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/dahlia/nirum-k5n5y/artifacts/nirum-win-x86.exe?job=Platform%3A%20x86&branch=master)\n-
  [Docker (`spoqa/nirum:latest`)][docker]\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nIn
  order to compile a Nirum package (`examples/`) to a Python package:\n\n    $ mkdir
  out/  # directory to place generated Python files\n    $ nirum -t python -o out/
  examples/\n\nFor more infomration, use `--help` option:\n\n    $ nirum --help\n
  \   Nirum: The IDL compiler and RPC/distributed object framework\n\n    Usage: nirum
  [-v|--version] (-o|--output-dir DIR) (-t|--target TARGET) DIR\n      Nirum compiler
  0.3.0\n\n    Available options:\n      -h,--help                Show this help text\n
  \     -v,--version             Show version\n      -o,--output-dir DIR      Output
  directory\n      -t,--target TARGET       Target language name. Available: docs,
  python\n      DIR                      Package directory\n\nThere is a [step-by-step
  tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md) as well.\n\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nIf you already
  installed [Haskell Stack][5], you can build the project\nin the same way to build
  other Haskell softwares:\n\n    $ stack build\n\nYou can run the test suite of Nirum:\n\n
  \   $ stack test  # unit test for compiler\n    $ ./lint.sh   # style lint\n\nFor
  details, please read the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n[5]: https://www.haskellstack.org/\n\n\nRelated
