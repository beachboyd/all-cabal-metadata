  # Grammatical Framework (GF)


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core)


  The Grammatical Framework is a grammar formalism based on type theory.

  It consists of:


  - a special-purpose programming language

  - a compiler of the language

  - a generic grammar processor


  The compiler reads GF grammars from user-provided files, and the

  generic grammar processor performs various tasks with the grammars:


  - generation

  - parsing

  - translation

  - type checking

  - computation

  - paraphrasing

  - random generation

  - syntax editing


  GF particularly addresses four aspects of grammars:


  - multilinguality (parallel grammars for different languages)

  - semantics (semantic conditions of well-formedness, semantic properties of expressions)

  - grammar engineering (modularity, abstractions, libraries)

  - embeddability in programs written in other languages (C, C++, Haskell, Java, JavaScript)


  ## Compilation and installation


  The simplest way of installing GF is with the command:

  ```

  cabal install

  ```


  For more details, see the [download page](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index.html)

  and [developers manual](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/gf-developers.html).


  ## About this repository


  On 2018-07-25, the monolithic [GF repository](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF)

  was split in two:


  1. [gf-core](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core) —  the GF compiler,
  shell and runtimes

  2. [gf-rgl](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl) — the resource grammar
  library


  The former repository is now archived and no longer updated.

  The split was performed using [this script](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF/blob/30ae1b5a5f73513ac5825ca6712186ef8afe9fd4/split/run.sh)

  and the output of that script is [here](https://gist.github.com/johnjcamilleri/a6c43ff61f15a9657b457ac94ab7db61).
