description: ! '"pdf2line" is a simple command-line utility to convert PDF into text.


  It is based on "pdftotext" from the Xpdf suite, but with a different

  layout algorithm that preserves relative column position and line spacing.


  To use it for anything other than ASCII text, you''d need to have a

  /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc or ~/.xpdfrc configured in a way that allows

  Xpdf''s "pdftotext" to run correctly for your purpose.
