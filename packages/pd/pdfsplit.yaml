description: ! 'Reading two-column academic papers is awkward on the

  Kindle; you sort of have to choose between zooming way

  out, so that the text is unreadably small, or zooming in

  far enough that the text is readable, but mucking around

  with the arrow navigation keys and never quite centering

  the text on the page. This program takes two-column papers

  on standard US-letter size paper and splits them down the

  middle, producing a PDF with one page for each column. On

  the Kindle, this makes the text large enough to read while

  still allowing the convenient, built-in navigation mode.'
