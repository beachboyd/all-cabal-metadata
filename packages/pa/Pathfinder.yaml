description: ! 'The library provides FFI bindings to the Pathfinder relational optimiser
  and

  code generator. Specifically, the library allows for


  * optimisation of table algebra (a variant of relational algebra) expressions


  * and compilation of table algebra expressions into SQL:1999 queries


  Note that the C source bundle of Pathfinder is also included in this

  package. The C sources are automatically built along with the Haskell FFI

  bindings. There is no need to download and install Pathfinder separately.


  More information about Pathfinder is available from the following web page:
