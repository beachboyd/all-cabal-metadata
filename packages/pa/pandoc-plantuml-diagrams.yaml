description: |-
  PlantUML renders different types of UML diagrams.
  This filter invokes plantuml.jar (which must be present
  in the current directory) for any yet unrendered diagrams.

  Diagrams are recognized in CodeBlocks that have the
  class "uml". It is advisable to also include an attribute
  "caption", which is rendered as alternate text for the image.
  If an ID is present, it is additionally appended compatible
  with pandoc-crossref.
