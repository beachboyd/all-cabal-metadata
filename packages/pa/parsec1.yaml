description: |-
  Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
  library.  It is simple, safe, well-known, has extensive libraries,
  good error messages, and is also fast.

  This package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2
  package as originally created by Daan Leijen. It is intended to
  preserve its simplicity and portability.

  This version differs from the pervious one only by a MonadFail
  instance to let it compile with ghc-8.8.
