  # Parochial

  Parochial is a tool for managing local haddocks and hoogle databases. I work in cafes and
  on the train plus I live in Australia where the internet speed is, err, somewhat
  variable. The other significant benefit I found when learning Haskell (and I'm _very_
  much still in that category) is knowing that I was reading the actual documentation of
  the installed library. For example if I searched for a function on
  [Hoogle](hoogle.haskell.org/) I wasn't sure if it was the correct function. In fact
  I still find this really useful.

  The whole point behind Parochial is to group the documentation on a project by project
  basis. For the html documentation it simply builds a symlink farm to the installed
  documentation in `$HOME/.cabal/...` (you will need to set the `-haddock` ghc option or
  set it in `$HOME/.cabal.broken/config` to ensure the documentation is built) in
  a directory named after the current project. For the hoogle database it does much the
  same but instead of building a symlink farm it builds a hoogle database, again named
  after the project.


  # Benefits

  * Fast.
  * Works without an internet connection.
  * Per project documentation.
  * Indexes *all* project libraries (including transitive dependencies). Hoogle only
    indexes [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/) which doesn't include everything on
    [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org).

  Of course the downside is that if you don't have the library in your cabal file you won't
  have any documentation for it.


  # Limitations

  This is still fairly raw and at an early stage of development but it's certainly usable
  and I will be adding to it over time.

  * Only works for Simple distributions.
  * Only tested with nix-style local builds.
  * Only works for projects that build a binary. You can work around this by specifying
    the state file with the --state command line option.
  * It's tied to a specific hoogle version so if the docs in `$HOME/.cabal/...` were built
    with a different version parochial will fail with a version mismatch error.
  * It's tied to a specific version of cabal. I _think_
    [cabal-helpr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-helper) should fix this but
    I need to look into it more.
  * If you want to access the hoogle database from a browser you will need to run `hoogle
    server` manually. This is probably fine if you mainly work on one project but would
    become annoying fairly quickly. The hoogle hrefs are file:///\<local/path\> which most
    browsers will refuse to render.
  * I'm sure there are others as well!


  # Usage

  ## Building the Documentation


  ```parochial --help``` displays a help message.


  If the project contains a single binary the following will work:

  for haddock:

  ```bash
  parochial haddock
  ```

  and hoogle:


  ```bash
  parochial hoogle
  ```

  If the project containes a single library then you will need to provide the `--state` option:

  for haddock:

  ```bash
  parochial haddock --state $(find . -name setup-config)
  ```

  and hoogle:

  ```bash
  parochial hoogle --state $(find . -name setup-config)
  ```

  It there is more than one library you will need to build each one separately (I want to
  fix this in the future):

  for haddock:

  ```bash
  find . -name setup-config | xargs -n1 parochial haddock --state
  ```

  and hoogle:

  ```bash
  find . -name setup-config | xargs -n1 parochial hoogle --state
  ```

  ## Reading the Documentation

  ### Serving up the html

  I use caddy to serve up the target directory but you can choose whatever you like, it
  just needs to be able to serve up some files. The following `Caddyfile` should do the job:

  ```
  localhost:80 {
    file_server browse
  }
  ```

  Either change the port number to above 1024 or set the following capability on the `caddy`
  binary. As root run:

  ```bash
  setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=ep $(which caddy)
  ```


  ### Command line hoogle

  You can specify the database on the command line, like so:

  ```bash
  hoogle --database=/srv/parochial/parochial.hoo Functor
  ```

  or write a simple wrapper script that infers the name of the database from the CWD or
  some other clue.


  # TODO

  * Don't hardcode `/srv/parochial` as the default place to put the documentation (this
    works for me and you can override it with the --target option but even so it's really
    me being very lazy!).
  * Work out a better way of locating the `setup-config` parent directory. I basically
    recurse the dist directory searching for `setup-config` which works but is pretty
    simplistic. I would have thought `Cabal` would have a way of doing this but I can't
    find it. If anyone knows how to do this please do let me know.
  * Integrate the local hoogle database and the local haddocks.
  * If the project has multiple local packages merge the results so the documentation is
    in a single place for the entire project.
  * Make the index page less ugly.
