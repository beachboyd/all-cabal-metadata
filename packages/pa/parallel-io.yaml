description: ! 'This package provides combinators for sequencing IO actions onto a
  thread pool. The

  thread pool is guaranteed to contain no more unblocked threads than a user-specified
  upper limit, thus

  minimizing contention.


  Furthermore, the parallel combinators can be used reentrantly - your parallel

  actions can spawn more parallel actions - without violating this property of the
  thread pool.


  The package is inspired by the thread <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/56499/focus=56521>.

  Thanks to Neil Mitchell and Bulat Ziganshin for some of the code this package is
  based on.'
