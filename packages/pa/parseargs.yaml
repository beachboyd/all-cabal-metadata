description: ! '# parseargs: Command-line argument parsing for Haskell programs

  Copyright (c) 2007 Bart Massey


  This library provides System.Console.Parseargs, a module to

  assist in argument parsing for Haskell stand-alone command

  line programs.


  The package provides a Haskell command-line argument

  "parser".  You supply a specification of the arguments to

  your command-line program; `parseargs` reads the arguments

  and checks that they meet your spec. It then fills in a data

  structure that captures the relevant data, from which parsed

  arguments can be extracted as needed. See the Haddock

  documentation for the gory details.


  I have used this code with `ghc` 6 and later on Linux.  It

  is a fairly standard Hackage-ready package, to the extent I

  know how to construct such.


  This library is not what I set out to build.  It definitely

  could also use some work.  However, I use it all the time

  for writing little programs. I thought others might find it

  useful, and I also have released other code that depends on

  it, so I put it out there.


  Have fun with it, and let me know if there are problems.


  ## Release History


  * The 0.1.2 release includes a typeclass for argument types for

  easier use.


  * The 0.1.3 release includes more uniform and usable error

  handling.


  * The various 0.1.3.x point releases include bug fixes and

  various extra-minor enhancements. See the Git log.


  * The 0.1.4 release includes the ability to mix optional and

  required positional arguments.


  * The 0.1.5 release includes the "soft dash" option, giving

  the ability to allow positional arguments to begin with a

  dash if possible.


  * The 0.1.5.1 release fixes some warnings and stuff.


  * The 0.1.5.2 release fixes some missing documentation.


  * The 0.2 release cleans up some namespace pollution by

  removing `ArgRecord` and the `args` accessor from the public

  namespace.  This allows the use of the name `args` by the

  user to describe program arguments.


  * The 0.2.0.1 release cleans up a bunch of documentation nits

  and cleans up copyright notices and license information.


  * The 0.2.0.2 release fixes the botched release of 0.2.0.1. Sigh.


  * The 0.2.0.3 release fixes the missing `Args` constructor

  documentation of 0.2.0.2.


  * The 0.2.0.4 release suppresses a GHC 7.10 warning for `Control.Monad.Safe`.
