description: ! 'Arrows are a suitable abstraction for parallel programming. This package
  offers a general interface for parallelizing Arrows. This package however only contains
  the interface and code written against it must be used with a backend such as @Parallel-Arrows-Multicore@,
  @Parallel-Arrows-ParMonad@, @Parallel-Arrows-Eden@ in order to have any parallel
  speedup. This package also contains some parallel skeletons such as variants of
  parMap and some topology skeletons.
