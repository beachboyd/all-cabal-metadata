description: ! 'This library is useful for running a large amount of parallel tasks

  that run on top of the IO monad, executing them in batches from a work queue.


  It has several features aimed at monitoring the progress of the tasks

  and tries to be reasonably efficient (in space and time) for large

  numbers (millions) of tasks.  There is also caching support available so that the
  results of

  running the task can be preserved between runs of the same program, which

  is useful for doing scientific analysis.'
