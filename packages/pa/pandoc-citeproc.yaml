synopsis: Supports using pandoc with citeproc
changelog: ! "pandoc-citeproc (0.14.4)\n\n  * Allow latest aeson (Adam Bergmark, #336).\n
  \ * Use latest hs-bibutils.\n  * NBIB support (#333, VÃ¡clav Haisman, API change).\n
  \ * Allow pandoc 2.3.x.\n  * Update tests for pandoc changes.\n  * Use recent yaml
  library that doesn't quote number ranges.\n    This required some adjustments in
  the tests.\n  * Use lts-12 for stack build.\n  * Use Yaml.decodeEither' instead
  of deprecated decodeEither.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.3.1)\n\n  * Allow pandoc 2.2.x.\n
  \ * Update locales and default csl.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.3)\n\n  * Fixed other-modules
  in cabal.\n  * Semigroup instances for Literal and CLabel.\n  * Use NoImplicitPrelude
  with custom prelude.\n    This allows ghci to work.\n  * stack.yaml - depend on
  released pandoc.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.2)\n\n  * Use custom Prelude to handle
  Monoid/Semigroup transition.\n  * Add Semigroup instance for Formatting (API change).\n
  \ * Bump aeson upper bound.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.1.5)\n\n  * Fixed 'capitalize-first'
  when the element begins with emphasis\n    or some other inline container.  Closes
  #322.\n  * test-pandoc-citeproc: make --accept work with biblio2yaml tests.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.14.1.4)\n\n  * Fixed sort order bugs (#320):\n\n    + Disregard ayn and hamza
  in sorting Arabic names.\n    + Proper treatment of spaces:  nothing comes before
  something,\n      but spaces INSIDE a given name or family name are ignored.\n    +
  Disregard punctuation and case.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.1.3)\n\n  * Bump xml-conduit
  version bound.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.1.2)\n\n  * Fix regression in JSON output
  for date-parts (#321).\n    Previous versions of represented dates as:\n    `\"issued\":
  {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}`.  pandoc-citeproc 0.14\n    did instead: `\"issued\":
  [{\"date-parts\": [2006]}]`.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.14.1.1)\n\n  * Fix regression
  in movement of punctuation inside quotes before note.\n    Example: `Here is a \"test
  citation\" [@item1].`\n    should become `Here is a a \"test citation.\"[^1]` (at
  least in\n    locales where punctuation moves inside quotes, like en-US).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.14.1)\n\n  * More robust handling of boolean metadata values.\n  * Keep position
  of citations with prefixes when sorting (behavior\n    change, #292).  If citations
  with prefixes are moved around,\n    gibberish can result.  E.g.:\n    `A fascinating
  research tidbit [@Zanadu1999, p. 35; see\n    for comparison @Aalto2005]` can become\n
  \   \"A fascinating research tidbit (see for comparison Aalto, 2005;\n    Zanadu,
  1999: 35)\" with a sorting style like sage-harvard.csl.\n    This change causes
  sorting to be applied only to subgroups of citations\n    that lack prefixes.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.14)\n\n  * Fix non-numerical season parsing in RefDate (#316).\n    These changes
  allow non-numerical dates to be handled.\n    API changes: season in RefDate is
  now Maybe Season instead\n    of Maybe Int. Text.CSL.Reference exports Season(..)
  and\n    seasonToInt.\n\n  * Fix parsing of season field in DateRef object.\n\n
  \ * Treat date-part with all 0s the same as empty.\n    This is used to indicate
  an open-ended range.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.13.0.1)\n\n  * Suppress empty footnotes.\n
  \ * Use walk instead of bottomUp.  This requires pandoc-types 1.17.3\n    but gives
  a  speed boost.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.13)\n\n  * Made bibliography parsing more
  efficient.  (API change)\n    This commit adds an extra parameter to the bibliography
  parsing\n    functions: readBibtex, readBibtexString, readBiblioString,\n    readBiblioFile.
  \ The extra (first) parameter is a function\n    from strings to booleans that acts
  as a filter on citation\n    identifiers, so that non-matching identifiers are not
  parsed\n    in full.  pandoc-citeproc now gets a list of the citation\n    identifiers
  in a document and passes it to readBiblio*,\n    which gives a very substantial
  speed increase with large\n    bibliographies.  This is most noticable with bibtex,\n
  \   biblatex, and yaml bibliographies.\n\n  * Improved RefDate type (#313, API change).
  \ RefDate fields\n    (month, day, season, year) were previously strings; they've\n
  \   been changed to Maybe Int.  In addition, the AddYaml class\n    is exported
  from Text.CSL.Util; (&=) is now a method of that\n    class.  Finally, parseEDTFDate
  is exported from Text.CSL.Reference,\n    and is used instead of the old date parsing
  code in\n    Text.CSL.Input.Bibtex.\n\n  * Link to bibliographies in undated citations,
  like\n    (Doe, n.d.) (#250).\n\n  * Bibtex parser: a few efficiency improvements.\n\n
  \ * pandoc-citeproc.hs - better exception messages for -y and -j.\n\n  * Added needed
  import of fromMaybe without embed_data_files.\n    This makes it possible to build
  pandoc-citeproc without\n    the embed_data_files flag again.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.12.2.5)\n\n  * Fixed spurious disambiguation on some date ranges (#312).\n\n
  \ * Fix spurious dash after date range in certain cases (#312).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.12.2.4)\n\n  * Properly fixed range delimiters.  Closes #312.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.12.2.3)\n\n  * Fix month range problems (#312).  Months in a range were being\n
  \   concatenated with no separator with some styles (e.g. apa.csl).\n\n  * Use pseudo-months
  in CSL JSON output (#103).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.12.2.2)\n\n  * Allow pandoc 2.1.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.12.2.1)\n\n  * Handle pseudo-months in CSL date-range (see #103).\n    Month
  13 = season 1, 14 = 2, also 21 = 1, 22 = 2, ...\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.12.2)\n\n
  \ * Improved parsing of raw dates.  First we attempt to parse them\n    as ISO dates
  or date ranges (allowing `~` at the end to indicate\n    \"circa\").\n\n  * Prefer
  'raw' even if it occurs with 'date-parts'.  (In this case\n    'date-parts' is ignored.)\n\n
  \ * Parse 'cheater' variables embedded in 'note' in CSL JSON (#192).\n    Both braced
  and newline forms are supported.\n\n  * Don't make title-case sensitive to locale
  for labels (#119).\n\n  * API change: export `rmTitleCase'` from Text.CSL.Style.\n\n
  \ * Improved raw date parsing (#103).\n\n    + We now only parse 'raw' if `date-parts`
  is empty or missing.\n    + Code for parsing raw dates moved from Text.CSL.Eval.Date
  to\n      Text.CSL.Reference.\n    + Use `other` field if we can't parse data.\n\n
  \ * Support `all-names-with-initials` disambiguation.\n\n  * Remove double quotes
  in parsing CSL family names.\n    CSL uses double quotes simply to protect the case
  in names.\n\n  * Text.CSL.Proc.Disamb: exclude year, year suffix, label\n    in
  detecting collisions, unless year-suffix set.\n    This causes us to pass several
  more citeproc tests.\n\n  * Parse 'raw' field in ref dates in CSL JSON.\n\n  * Accept
  numerical versions of boolean parse-names in CSL JSON input.\n    This is mainly
  useful for avoiding errors in test-citeproc.\n\n  * Support 'film' as synonym of
  'motion_picture'.\n    I don't see this documented, but a test case in the citeproc\n
  \   test suite depends on it.\n\n  * Support citations-rtf mode in test-citeproc.\n\n
  \ * Preserve soft breaks in HTML output.  This allows us to pass more\n    citeproc
  test cases.\n\n  * Parse 'season' properly in CSL YAML or JSON dates (#309).\n\n
  \ * Fix \"primary-name\" name disambiguation (#38).  This also sets the\n    default
  to \"by-cite\", since that is now the CSL default.  However,\n    more adjustments
  are needed, as we now fail some citeproc tests we\n    passed before.\n\n  * test-citeproc
  improvements:\n\n    + , use new citeproc (git) test suite, not the old hg one.\n
  \   + Build test-citeproc too in default Makefile target.\n    + Handle boolean
  values for 'citations' in test data.\n\n  * Add tests for issue #87.\n\n  * Added
  `-threaded` to `ghc-options` (#311).\n\n  * Added biblatex-examples.bib to data
  files.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.12.1.1)\n\n  * Avoid double punctuation when citation
  ends with 'et al.' (#262).\n  * Fix collapsing for items that lack an author (#152).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.12.1)\n\n  * Fixed cases where we got plural instead of singular \"issue\"\n
  \   or \"volume\" (#307).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.12)\n\n  * Text.CSL.Exception: add
  `renderError`.\n  * Text.CSL.Input.Bibtex: remove `readBibtexString'` (pure version).\n
  \   We don't use this.  And we've refactored to raise better errors.\n  * Improved
  error handling.  Throw a CiteprocException instead of\n    using 'error', and render
  this nicely.\n  * Update chicago-author-date.csl and locales.\n  * Updated tests
  for chicago-author-date.csl  and locale changes.\n  * Pandoc compat module:  ensure
  `writeNative` includes the header.\n  * Use `--accept` instead of `--regenerate`
  in tests to regenerate test\n    cases.\n  * Bibtex parser: handle comments better
  (#306).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.11.1.3)\n\n  * Align static flag with pandoc's.\n
  \ * Update version bound for xml-conduit.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.11.1.2)\n\n  * Fixed
  quotes in three test cases.  We'd been using straight quotes.\n  * Use latest hs-bibutils.\n
  \ * Update compat for latest pandoc 2.0.\n  * Change type of compat's fetchItem
  so it doesn't take\n    a datadir argument.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.11.1.1)\n\n  *
  Added containers to build deps for test-pandoc-citeproc.\n  * Fix titlecase when
  a colon is inside an emph (#301).\n  * Titlecasing: never lowercase anything except
  stop words (#301).\n  * Text.CSL.Compat.Pandoc: disable `bracketed_spans` extension.\n
  \   We want to stay compatible with CSL standards, which understand a span\n    tag
  but not the brackets.\n  * Titlecase transform: start new sentence after \".\".
  \ \"Foo bar. An essay.\"\n  * Use set for short words lookup (performance).\n  *
  Case transform:  recognize mixed upper+punct as all uppercase (#301).\n    This
  helps with things like \"N.R. Kerr\".\n  * Add 'static' Cabal flag.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.11.1)\n\n * Don't produce ??? with empty suppress-author citation (#156).\n *
  Added Typeable, Data instances for CiteprocException. This\n   is needed for some
  older ghc versions.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.11)\n\n  * Add Text.CSL.Exception module
  exporting CiteprocException [API change].\n  * Throw CiteprocExceptions instead
  of crashing with 'error'.  This\n    should lead to better error messages in pandoc
  when pandoc-citeproc fails.\n  * Compat.Pandoc: support for pandoc 2.0 API with
  Text instead of String.\n  * Text.CSL.Input.Bibtex - revise item parser for better
  error messages.\n    This should give us better messages when someone uses a bad
  character\n    in a citation key.\n  * Use defConfig from aeson-pretty.  Otherwise
  we get an error with newer\n    versions, which added a field to the Config record.\n
  \ * Removed old hsb2hs-specific stuff from Setup.hs.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.10.5.1)\n\n
  \ * Minor tweaks for clean CI builds.\n  * Require recent yaml for uniform test
  output.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.10.5)\n\n  * Use file-embed instead of hsb2hs for
  embed_data_files flag (#285).\n  * Allow `&` in bibtex keys (#289).  They are discouraged
  because of\n    problems in tables, but technically they are allowed.\n  * Allow
  + in bibtex field name (#290).  BibLaTeX now allows things like\n    `author+an`
  for annotations.  See \"Data Annotations\" in the bibtex manual.\n    Note that
  we don't actually parse the annotations, we just don't\n    crash on bibtex files
  that include them.\n  * caseTransform:  fix corner case where last word has internal
  periods\n    (#288).  E.g. in `www.example.com`, previously `com` was capitalized\n
  \   as the last word.\n  * If there's a list of csl, locale, or abbrev files, use
  the last one.\n  * Don't catch exceptions in reading CSL file.  Previously some
  exceptions\n    were silently caught, leading to unexpected use of the default.\n
  \ * Util.findFile:  return right away if absolute path.\n  * Added mechanism for
  inserting raw content into delimiters, prefixes, suffixes.\n    So, for example,
  in your CSL file you can have\n\n        prefix=\"{{html}}&lt;i&gt;{{/html}}\"\n\n
  \   and this will turn into\n\n        RawInline (Format \"html\") \"<i>\"\n\n    rather
  than, as before\n\n        Str \"<i>\",\n\n    which would get escaped in the output.\n
  \   See jgm/pandoc#3536 for the motivation.\n  * Text.CSL.Pandoc: Simplified code
  for looking up default CSL.\n  * Fix titlecase bug involving em/en dashes (#284).\n
  \ * Export license from Text.CSL.Data.Embedded.\n  * Added `--license` to CLI and
  `getLicense` to Text.CSL.Data (API change).\n  * Updated chicago-author-date.csl
  and locales xml.\n  * Add `getManPage` to Text.CSL.Data and `--man` option to CLI
  (API change).\n    `pandoc-citeproc --man` now simply spits out the man page in\n
  \   groff format.  For a plain text version, use\n    `pandoc-citeproc --man | groff
  -mman -Tutf8`.  For an HTML version,\n    `pandoc-citeproc --man | groff -mman -Thtml`.\n
  \ * Updates to be able to compile and test with current pandoc HEAD.\n  * Automatically
  link ISBN references to Worldcat (#279).\n    This is similar to existing support
  for DOIs.  Thanks to Eric Marsden.\n  * Text.CSL.Input.Bibtex: export `Lang`, `langToLocale`,
  `getLangFromEnv`\n    (#281, API change).\n  * Adjusted treatment of `\\hyphen`
  now that pandoc includes trailing space...\n    in RawInline.  See jgm/pandoc#1773
  and commit\n    f4a452f89174828fea77614a4b6a067fc4675ba5.\n  * Support citation-label
  variable (#160, Lukas Atkinson).\n    The `citation-label` was not rendered, even
  when this label was\n    explicitly set in the bibliography. This is now fixed.
  Citation labels\n    are modelled after citation numbers. In particular, citation
  labels can\n    also be hyperlinked.  API changes:\n\n    In `Text.CSL,Reference`:
  The exported type `CLabel` describes a label\n    name in the CSL variables. This
  allows us to distinguish labels from\n    ordinary strings. This type is analogous
  to `CNum`.\n\n    In `Text.CSL.Style`: In `Output` the `OCitLabel` case describes
  a label\n    in the rendered output. This case is analogous to `OCitNum`.\n  * Allow
  aeson 1.2.\n  * Fixed overlapping instance problem in test-citeproc w/ recent aeson.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.4.1)\n\n  * Raise version bounds for xml-conduit.\n  * Use cpphs if embed_data_files
  on darwin.\n  * Fixed Compat module so it compiles with pandoc 1.9.x and 2.0.\n
  \ * Allow colon to belong to locator numbers (#275).\n    This at least allows 1:22-23
  to be interpreted as a page number, though\n    this won't really be useful until
  we modify the number collapsing code to\n    be sensitive to the colon.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.4)\n\n  * Fixed 'et al' in certain styles (#274).  The `et al` phrase was\n
  \   not being appended in the bibliography in ieee.csl and some others.\n  * Leave
  ALLCAPS words alone in titlecase transformation.\n    See #273.  There is some confusion
  about the citeproc\n    rules here, but this follows citeproc-js behavior.\n  *
  Improved title case rules to conform better to CSL spec (#273).\n    We now correctly
  retain case on mixed-case words and don't\n    decapitalize \"small words\" when
  they're the last word.\n  * Use readerSmart in parsing yaml bibliographies (#272).\n
  \ * Bumped some dependency version bounds.\n  * Improved .travis.yml.\n  * Added
  Text.CSL.Compat.Pandoc module to work around version differences.\n    This allows
  building with the typeclass branch of pandoc.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.10.3)\n\n  *
  Update to work with pandoc 1.19 (including writerStandalone API change).\n  * Updated
  test case to use bracketed_spans.  Note: this means that tests\n    will fail unless
  pandoc 1.19 is used.\n  * Fixed pluralization with label for issue (#267).\n  *
  Factored out `comb` in Text.CSL.Pandoc.\n  * Make it clearer when errors concern
  CSL parsing (#219).\n    Errors in CSL parsing now point to the CSL file specifically.\n
  \   We convert any error thrown in CSL parsing into an XMLException\n    (from xml-conduit),
  so the file path will be shown.\n  * Handle EDTF dates in bibtex bibliographies
  (#240).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.10.2.2)\n\n  * Fix overlapping instances with aeson-1.0.2.1
  (#263).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.10.2.1)\n\n  * Allow pandoc 1.18.x.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.2)\n\n  * Use linebreaks to simulate display=\"block\" (#85, #261).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.1.4)\n\n  * Use finer grained Pandoc import statements (Albert Krewinkel).\n
  \   A full import of the Pandoc library leads to name collisions with Pandoc\n    v1.18,
  so only required functions and datatypes are imported.\n  * Remove unused import.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.1.3)\n\n  * Fixed compiler warnings.\n  * Setup.hs - removed unnecessary imports.\n
  \ * Travis improvements.  Run on stack lts-7, not earlier.\n    Disable optimizations
  for faster build.  Turn on warnings.\n  * Bump pandoc-types to 1.17.0.3 in stack.yaml.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.1.2)\n\n  * Implemented notes-after-punctuation metadata field (#256).\n    If
  this is true (the default), citations rendered as footnotes\n    are automatically
  moved after punctuation.  If it is false,\n    footnote citations remain before
  punctuation, but space is still\n    collapsed before the notes.\n  * Don't require
  http-client 0.5.  This mirrors recent changes to pandoc,\n    which allow 0.4.30.x.\n
  \ * Allow pandoc-types 1.17.*.\n  * Allow xml-conduit 1.4.x (Felix Yan).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.1.1)\n\n  * Clarify that abbreviations require `form=\"short\"` (Nick Bart).\n
  \ * Allow aeson 1.0.*.\n  * Input.Bibtex:  better parsing for month.  Don't convert
  to lowercase if\n    it's not one of the official abbreviations and isn't protected.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.10.1)\n\n  * pandoc-citeproc: allow .yaml and .json input files, even without
  the\n    `bibutils` flag, for conversion to JSON and YAML, resp.\n  * Pluralize
  locator term when comma-separated series of numbers given\n    (#245).\n  * Don't
  insert bibliography if there are no entries (#249).\n  * Fixed note field with YAMl
  bibliographies (#224).  Supplementary fields\n    in `note` are parsed only in CSL
  JSON.\n  * Support latest aeson-pretty (Felix Yan).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.10)\n\n
  \ * Allow colons in bibtex field names (John MacFarlane, #220).\n  * Set LANG as
  well as LC_ALL before translating bibtex (John MacFarlane).\n    This ensures that
  bibtex will use the locale specified\n    in the document, even if the system locale
  is different.\n  * Data:  Raise CSLLocaleException if locale not found (John MacFarlane).\n
  \   Minor API change:  Export CSLLocaleException.\n  * Added DeriveDataTypeable
  pragma to Data (John MacFarlane).\n  * Bibtex reader: case-insensitive parsing of
  month names (John MacFarlane).\n  * Bibtex: Export readBibtexInputString', a pure
  version of\n    readBibtexInputString (John MacFarlane).\n  * Rename readBibtexInput*
  -> readBibtex* (John MacFarlane, API change).\n  * unTitleCase now lowercases whole
  word (#234, John MacFarlane).\n    So, for example, unprotected TeV becomes tev,
  instead of teV.\n    This mimics bibtex's own behavior.\n  * Added caseTransform
  parameter on readBibtex* functions (#231, John\n    MacFarlane).  When set to false,
  the bibtex reader doesn't do the\n    'untitlecase' transformation.  This is used
  in Text.CSL.Input.Bibutils,\n    when using bibtex as an intermediate format for
  conversion from mods,\n    ris, or other formats.  Otherwise we get the 'untitlecase'
  transform\n    when it isn't wanted.\n  * Allow numbers with decimal points to count
  as \"numeric.\" (#208,\n    John MacFarlane) Thus, we should have \"Series 2.2\",
  not \"Series, 2.2\" with\n    Chicago author-date style.\n  * Fixed capitalization
  for words following slash (#236, John MacFarlane).\n  * Updated locales.\n  * Fix
  build failure for --flags=-bibutils mode (Sergei Trofimovich).\n    Reported-by
  Thomas Beutin https://bugs.gentoo.org/516640.\n  * Add missing -DUSE_BIBUTILS to
  Cabal build (Vaclav Haisman).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.9.1.1)\n\n  * Only changed version
  number (work around for hackage upload error).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.9.1)\n\n  *
  Fixed YAML/CSL reference type for motion_picture, etc. (#214).\n    Several CSL
  reference types (`motion_picture`, `legal_case`, ...)\n    use an underscore instead
  of a hyphen, and these had been\n    incorrectly rendered by pandoc when translating
  to YAML/CSL.\n  * Fixed handling of dimension and other 'literal' variables (#213).\n
  \   This also affects call-number, scale, language.\n  * Fixed test-citeproc.\n
  \ * Fixed travis builds to use stack.\n  * Only use -rtsopts for executable.\n  *
  Allow aeson 0.11.\n  * Allow compilation with pandoc 1.17.\n  * Updated locales
  and chicago-author-date.csl.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.9)\n\n  * Allow spaces around
  CSL note fields.  Closes #191.\n  * Add homepage field to .cabal file (Jens Petersen).\n
  \ * Use pandoc 1.16.\n  * Turn on smart quote parsing in reading bib(la)tex.  We
  didn't\n    need this previously, but now we do thanks to changes in pandoc.\n  *
  Specialize `mkRefMap` to `Reference`, and return empty map for\n    `emptyReference`.\n
  \ * Improved behavior with missing references (API change, #195, #165).\n    Previously
  in some cases where a citation id wasn't found\n    in the bibliography, a \"reference
  with no printed form\"\n    warning was printed instead of \"not found.\" This change
  fixes that.\n    It also changes some types in ways that make more sense.\n    `processCites`
  now produces `[[(Cite, Maybe Reference)]]`\n    instead of `[[(Cite, Reference)]]`,
  and other types are\n    adjusted accordingly.  For example, `evalLayout` now\n
  \   has a `Maybe Reference` parameter rather than `Reference`.\n  * Added `hackage-docs.sh`
  to upload haddocks when Hackage can't build them.\n  * Improved handling of `nocite`
  (#197).  Previously if you had something in\n    `nocite`, then cited it again in
  the document, pandoc-citeproc would use\n    `ibid`, thinking that the item had
  already been cited.\n  * Fix for pandoc API change to `writerWrapOptions`.\n  *
  Allow `SoftBreak` to count as space in some contexts (e.g. splitting).\n  * Fixed
  path to `chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl` in test.\n  * Improved error message
  with illegal 'type' field in YAML\n    bibliographies (#2611).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.8.1.3)\n\n  * test-pandoc-citeproc: Better fix for Windows.  Use UTF8 strings\n
  \   instead of bytestrings; this helps get line endings right in tests.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.8.1.2)\n\n  * Use UTF8 versions of readFile in test program.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.8.1.1)\n\n  * Use pandoc's UTF8 versions of getContents, putStrLn, etc.\n    Otherwise
  we get locale-dependent encodings.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.8.1)\n\n  * Improved performance
  in bibtex cross-reference resolution (#190).\n  * Take 'form' for date-part elements
  from date if not specified (#116).\n    Previously if the 'form' were unspecified
  in a date-part\n    element, it would go to the default 'long', even if the\n    date
  as a whole was 'numeric'.\n  * Transform only uppercase ASCII letters in titlecase
  transform.\n    This helps us pass one more citeproc test case.\n  * Cleaned up
  locator parsing code.\n  * Allow roman numeral locators (#173.\n  * Fixed missing
  dash between months in date ranges (#175).\n  * Fixed `strip-periods` (#185).\n
  \ * Parse supplementary fields in CSL JSON \"note\" fields (#94).\n  * Support more
  biblatex markup in converting biblatex bibliographies:\n    `mkbibemph`, `mkbibitalic`,
  `mkbibbold`, `mkbibparens`, `mkbibbrackets`,\n    `autocap` (Nick Bart, #26).  Treat
  reviews as articles.\n  * Add biblatex keys for additional languages (Nick Bart).\n
  \ * Use HTTPS for DOI resolver (Andrew Dunning).\n  * Add biblatex keys for additional
  languages (Nick Bart):\n    ca-AD, da-DK, es-ES, fi-FI, it-IT, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-PT,
  pt-BR, sv-SE\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.8.0.1)\n\n  * Allow aeson 0.10.x (Felix Yan).\n
  \ * Add custom Prelude: -Wall clean on ghc 7.10.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.8)\n\n  *
  Use `lang` metadata field to specify locale.  `locale` can still\n    be used as
  before, for backwards compatibility, but `lang` is\n    now preferred.\n  * Put
  the references section header outside the Div, instead\n    of inside as before..
  \ This interacts better with pandoc's\n    `--section-divs` feature (#176).\n  *
  Use `refs`, not `references`, for the identifier of the\n    bibliography Div.  Unlike
  `references`, `refs` is not\n    likely to conflict with an autogenerated header
  identifier (#176).\n    NOTE:  workflows designed to work with 0.7.4, with a\n    `<div
  id=\"references\"></div>` where the bibliography is\n    to go, will need modification
  (`s/references/refs/`).\n  * Changed local override for default CSL file (#161).\n
  \   Previously you could override the default CSL file by\n    modifying `~/.csl/chicago-author-date.csl`.
  \ Now you do\n    it by modifying `~/.csl/default.csl`.  To minimize the effect\n
  \   of this change on existing workflows, we will use the version\n    of `chicago-author-date.csl`
  in `~/.csl`, if there is one,\n    if `~/.csl/default.csl` is not found.\n  * Implemented
  fallbacks for CSL terms, as per CSL spec.\n    E.g. `verb` is used if `verb-short`
  is not defined (#72).\n  * Update CSL style, locales (Andrew Dunning).\n  * Setup.hs:
  \ got hsb2hs registered as a build-tool.\n  * Setup.hs: avoid depending on non-base
  modules (esp. process).\n    This can cause problems with older versions of cabal.\n
  \ * Don't raise error if `HOME` isn't defined (#35).\n  * Add more biblatex localization
  keys (Nick Bart).\n  * Simplified and improved page range collapsing (#168).\n  *
  Allow multiword locator labels like \"sub verbo\" (#168).\n  * Remove `parse-names:
  true` in a Reference after parsing\n    names (#169).\n  * Don't superscript author-in-text
  numerical citations (#133).\n    This change also removes `unsetAffixes` from `Text.CSL.Style`'s\n
  \   exported functions.  This function was only used in one places\n    and is very
  simple.  (API change)\n  * Fixed `embed_data_files` build on OS X (Chris Knox)\n
  \ * Remove brackets from author-in-text numerical citations (#133).\n  * Removed
  `compressName` transform on JSON output (#169).\n    This transformation prevented
  the JSON produced from\n    using a fully broken-out specification of the author,\n
  \   instead pushing suffixes and prefixes into the names\n    themselves.\n  * Fixed
  regression introduced by #163 (#170).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7.4)\n\n  * Bibliography
  Div has id `references`, in addition to class.\n  * Make sure a link with a year
  range encompasses the whole range.\n    Previously you'd get [LINK 1996]--[LINK
  2003], where both\n    links went to the same citation.  Now you get [LINK 1996-2003].\n
  \   (#146)\n  * Fix linking of DOIs (#163).  Now only a part of a prefix that\n
  \   begins a url (`http...`) will be part of the linked text for a DOI.\n    (This
  part will also be used for the URL, in place of the default\n    `http://doi.org/`,
  if present.) Other parts of the prefix and suffix\n    will remain outside the linked
  text.\n  * Use \"literal\" instead of \"other\" in producing CSL YAML (#167).\n
  \ * Test suite: better technique to find right executable to test.\n    We now find
  the test program and locate pandoc-citeproc relative\n    to it.\n  * Change default
  for parse-names to False.\n  * Add `Paths_pandoc_citeproc` to other-modules.\n  *
  Allow flexible insertion of bibliography.\n    + If the document contains a Div
  element with id `references`,\n      the bibliography will be inserted in it (after
  any other content\n      in the Div).\n    + Otherwise, a Div with id `references`
  will be created at the\n      end of the document as before.\n  * Fix parsing of
  particles with hyphens on family names (#130).\n  * Handle `#+LINK_CITATIONS` metadata
  in org-mode.  The values `true`,\n    `yes`, and `on` are recognized as true values
  (case-insensitive)\n    (#159).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7.3.1)\n\n  * Moved tests
  from data-files to extra-source-files.\n  * List biblatex conversion tests in cabal
  extra-source-files.\n  * Updated tests for changes in yaml library (which now\n
  \   puts quotes arounds strings that could be read as numbers, #158).\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.7.3)\n\n  * Add Walkable instances for Formatted (Sean Leather).\n  * Allow empty
  end year in Zotero workaround, e.g. `2005_` (Nick Bart).\n  * man/Makefile - removed
  unnecessary dependency.\n  * Fixed test-citeproc.hs for change in `ProcOpts`.\n
  \ * Cleaned up Setup.hs. Now takes into account destdir in copying man page.\n  *
  Donât add space after particles ending with \"-\" (Nick Bart).\n  * Names.hs: Add
  Unicode âLatin Extended Additionalâ to isByzantine (Nick\n    Bart).\n  * Allow
  vector 0.11.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7.2)\n\n  * Added `link-citations` metadata field
  (#141).  If this has a true value,\n    citations in author-date and numerical styles
  are linked to their\n    corresponding bibliography entries.  Otherwise not.  (In
  previous\n    versions of 0.7.x, this linking was the default.  Now it must be\n
  \   enabled explicitly by setting this field.)\n  * Fixed locale lookup with two-letter
  codes (#140).\n  * Updated locales and chicago-author-date.csl.\n  * Text.CSL.Data:
  Remove spurious reference to ar-AR.\n  * Updated tests to escape literal `[` and
  `]` (to match\n    new pandoc markdown writer's behavior).\n  * Fixed `make update`
  to grab chicago-author-date.csl from correct URL.\n  * Bumped upper bound to allow
  aeson 0.9.*.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7.1.1)\n\n  * Fixed regression in numerical citation
  collapsing (#131).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7.1)\n\n  * Improvements to numerical styles:\n
  \   + Space is now inserted after the reference number in the\n      bibliography
  when `second-field-align` is `margin` or `flush`.\n    + Author-in-text citations
  are now treated just like other citations\n      in numerical styles.  So, brackets
  are used, and the term\n      \"Reference\" is not added: instead of `Reference
  1 says...`\n      we have `[1] says...`.  This seems to accord better with e.g.\n
  \     IEEE practice.\n    + Improved citation collapsing.  Now both the new and
  the old versions\n      of `ieee.csl` work properly.  Previously brackets were dropped
  with\n      the new version (#55).\n    + Use new `ieee.csl` for testing.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.7.0.2)\n\n  * Bump version bound for xml-conduit.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7.0.1)\n\n
  \ * In YAML use pandoc markdown syntax for super, subscript (#128).\n    Added test
  case for rich text formatting.\n  * Change default for first-reference-note-number
  to 0 on reading (#128).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.7)\n\n  * Improved YAML output:\n
  \   + Fields are now in a deterministic and rational order, id at top.\n    + Blank
  lines between entries for readability.\n    + Use human-friendlier year, month,
  etc. rather than date-part.\n    + The test suite no longer normalizes YAML output
  before comparing,\n      since we now control the order of fields.\n  * Use `locale`
  in metadata in converting bibtex (#98).\n  * Use `locale` in metadata for unicode
  collation, when compiled with\n    the `unicode_collation` flag (#122).\n  * Made
  pandoc-citeproc sensitive to metadata fields\n    `reference-section-title` and
  `suppress-bibliography` (Jesse\n    Rosenthal).  The former specifies a title for
  a new reference section.\n    The second suppresses the bibliography altogether.
  \ Existing\n    documents should behave as before if these fields are not used.\n
  \ * Strip empty span elements from output (#126).\n  * Allow conversion FROM yaml
  to other formats (#124).\n  * Improved CSL JSON output. Use the rich markup syntax
  described at\n    http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0/release-notes.html#rich-text-markup-within-fields\n
  \ * Fixed extraction of language from LANG env variable in Bibtex (#98).\n  * Fixed
  `ghc-prof-options` so we don't get warning with recent cabal.\n    Added French,
  German localizations to Bibtex converter (#98).\n  * Bibtex: Use type field to further
  specify mastersthesis or phdthesis (#98).\n  * Ensure that \"et al\" has a space
  before it, if no delimiter defined (#93).\n  * Allow \"et al\" to be formatted (#91).\n
  \ * Depend on `setenv` package for the `setEnv` function, which is found\n    only
  in base 4.7+.\n  * Fixed problem with droppped final punctuation in some footnotes
  (#82).\n  * `Text.CSL.Util`: Removed unused `readable`. Renamed `toShow` to\n    `uncamelize`.
  Use `ppShow` in `tr'`.\n  * Use `doi.org` instead of `dx.doi.org` (#107).\n  * Fixed
  treatment of `motion_picture` title (#118).\n  * Include preface and suffix of DOI
  in linked text (#107).\n  * Added `--regenerate` flag to `test-pandoc-citeproc`.\n
  \ * Added `hyperlink` field to `Formatting` (API change).\n  * Made hyperlinked
  citations work with numerical  and author-year styles.\n  * Bibtex: improved short
  title logic.\n  * Map biblatex title/maintitle to CSL volume-title/title (Nick Bart).\n
  \ * Fix CSL dependent style support (Tim Lin, #105).\n  * Added support for PMCID
  and PMID fields in bibtex (jgm/pandoc#1923).\n  * Map biblatex `inreference` to
  `EntryEncyclopedia` rather than `NoType`\n    (#88).\n  * Wrap bibliography entries
  in Div with id=ref-citationId\n  * Updated `chicago-author-date.csl`.\n  * Allow
  compilation against pandoc 1.14 (the next release).\n  * Removed obsolete `small_base`
  cabal flag.\n  * Added `debug` cabal flag which turns on tracing.\n\npandoc-citeproc
  (0.6.0.1)\n\n  * Added pandoc-types upper bound.\n  * Removed `auto-all` from profiling
  options.\n  * Fixed CSL dependent style support (#105, Tim Lin).\n  * Updates to
  build with GHC 7.10.1 (Mark Wright).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.6)\n\n  * The CSL parser
  has been replaced with a new, xml-conduit based module,\n    which does not rely
  on C libraries and should be easier to repair\n    and extend.  The module has been
  checked against the old module with all\n    CSL files in the citeproc repository.
  \ The only differences\n    are with attribute values beginning or ending with a
  nonbreaking\n    space (e.g. with French guillemets), and the new parser's behavior\n
  \   (preserving the spaces) is clearly correct.  Parsing was measured as\n    about
  twice as fast in a benchmark.\n  * The `hexpat` cabal flag has been removed.\n  *
  The old `Text.CSL.Pickle` and `Text.CSL.Pickle.*` modules have been\n    removed.\n
  \ * Plural locator labels (e.g. 'pp.') are now used for page ranges\n    containing
  en-dashes (#84).\n  * `Elements` has been removed from `Element`.  It was entirely
  unnecessary,\n    used only once (and dispensibly) in `Text.CSL.Eval`.\n    This
  change results in cleaner code.\n  * Improved man page generation.\n  * Updated
  `chicago-author-date.csl` default style.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.5)\n\n  * Revised
  locator parsing:\n    + parseLocator now looks for the \"short\" forms of terms
  in\n      the style's locale(s).  So, in English you'd use \"p.\" or\n      \"ch.\";
  in German, \"S.\" or \"Kap.\"\n    + Note that the locator label must match what
  is in the locale\n      file, including the period.  Before this change, you could
  omit\n      the period: \"p 12\" or \"p. 12\" would both give you a \"page.\"\n
  \     Also, previously, the locators were case-insensitive; now they must\n      be
  in the same case as in the locale.  (English \"p.\", German \"S.\".)\n    + \"no.\"
  no longer gets parsed as a \"note\": closes #74.\n    + Text.CSL.Reference no longer
  exports parseLocator.\n      parseLocator is now used only locally, in Text.CSL.Pandoc.\n
  \ * Data.getLocale:  Try 2-letter locale lookup if longer locale not found.\n    This
  should fix an error that occured with less common locales\n    (jgm/pandoc#1548).\n
  \ * Added parseNames field to Agent.  Set parse-names=true\n    when writing CSL
  JSON and collapsing suffix or particles into\n    first or last names.\n  * Properly
  handle agents with 'parse-names' set to 'true' (#77).\n    Note that parse-names
  defaults to true if not set, as in Zotero.\n  * Reference:  added explicit exports.\n
  \ * Styles:  Added explicit export list.\n  * Eval: Fixed isNumericString to recognize
  en dash (#74).\n  * Allow bibtex double quotes to be escaped inside {} (jgm/pandoc#1568).\n
  \ * Titlecase transform improvements (#76).\n  * Added two csl files missing from
  tests/.\n  * Performance improvements:  Avoid unnecessary Output groupings.\n    Eliminated
  some unnecessary generic traversals.  (#71)\n  * Makefile:  Use cpphs. Text.CSL.Data
  seems to break on OSX 10.9 without it.\n  * Added prof target to Makefile\n  * Test
  suite: don't exit with success if there were errors!\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.4.0.1)\n\n
  \ * Interpret date literals with underscores (e.g. \"2004_2006\") as ranges.\n    This
  covers a common workaround for a deficiency in Zotero (#65).\n  * Correctly handle
  \"literal\" in CSL date (#65).\n  * Fixed erroneous capitalization of the first
  ibid. in a citation,\n    even in the middle of a sentence (#68).  Removed \"ibid-c\",\n
  \   \"ibid-locator-c\" classifications.\n  * Pandoc:  Capitalize first word of citation
  note, unless span=nocase.\n    Previously we only capitalized citations.  This captures
  ibid\n    and the like.\n  * Text.CSL.Util.toCapital:  respect `<span class=\"nocase\">`.\n
  \ * Turn small caps into SmallCaps element in reading CSL JSON (#67).\n    Either
  the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\"> or the <sc>\n    variant may be used.\n
  \ * Added \"ca\", \"c\", \"et\" to list of short words in titlecase transforms\n
  \   (#66).\n  * Fixed some errors in the no-author test case.\n  * test-pandoc-citeproc:
  \ Avoid running tests twice!\n  * Check for en dash in checking for page ranges
  (#70).\n  * Removed unused texmath build-depend.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.4)\n\n  *
  Fixed #58 - previously not all substitute alternatives were tried.\n  * Made first
  parameter of OName an Agent, not a String (API change).\n    Also moved Agent from
  Reference to Style.\n  * test-pandoc-citeproc: run tests on all matching files in
  the directory.\n    This removes the need to recompile when new tests are added.\n
  \ * Style: Fixed appendWithPunct (mappend for Formatted).  One definition\n    was
  wrong, causing commas to be lost in certain places (#57).\n  * Support \\nocite{*}.
  \ If the `nocite` metadata filed contains a citation\n    with identifier `*`, all
  entries in the bibliography are included\n    in the references (#64).\n  * Bump
  upper bound for aeson.\n  * Removed span nodecor around 'ser.' (#60).\n  * Print
  series as \"3rd ser.\" (using locale's ordinal) (#60).\n  * Added scaffolding for
  'ordinalize' and infrastructure for\n    accessing locale information to Bibtex.\n
  \ * Export new parseLocale from Text.CSL.Parser.\n  * Move punctuation before fn
  in in-text citation before punctuation (#59).\n  * Updated locales and chicago-author-date.csl.\n
  \ * Use collection-title for series, even for articles (#60).\n  * Fixed locator
  parsing so capital roman numerals are legal numbers (#61).\n  * Map bookinbook ->
  chapter (#62).\n  * Better error message from parseString.\n  * Remove space before
  superscript citation (pandoc #1327).\n  * Fixed spurious \"et al\" problem (#27).\n
  \ * Match biblatex's method for separating von from last name, for biblatex.\n    For
  bibtex, we match the documented bibtex algorithm as before (#50).\n    Test case:
  \ Drummond de Andrade, Carlos.\n    bibtex makes \"Drummond de\" a dropping particle.\n
  \   biblatex takes \"Drummond de Andrade\" to be the last name.\n  * Leave off bibliography
  if `suppress-bibliography` has a true value\n    in the document metadata (#40,
  with thanks to Jesse Rosenthal).\n  * Try empty (null) 'csl' as if no 'csl' was
  specified.\n    (The default chicago-author-date.csl is then used.)\n  * Fixed #51:
  \ empty braces with date range.\n  * Set pageFirst automatically from page range
  (#31).\n  * Bibtex input: set page-first automatically.\n  * Fixed capitalization
  of first word in sentence (#25).\n    E.g. \"foo bar baz: bazbaz foo\" should turn
  into\n    \"Foo Bar Baz: Bazbaz Foo\" in titlecase, but was turning into\n    \"foo
  Bar Baz: bazbaz Foo.\"\n  * pandoc-citeproc:  Allow conversion of mods bibliographies
  (#28).\n  * readCSLFile now supports dependent styles (#30).\n  * Removed network
  flag.  We now use pandoc's fetchItem.\n  * Changed type of findFile, so it returns
  a Maybe.\n  * Documented fact that you can specify a URL under 'csl:'.\n  * Added
  locale parameter to readCSLFile (API change).\n    readCSLFile also now looks in
  ~/.csl for the file, if it isn't\n    found locally.\n  * Moved findFile to Util.\n
  \ * Bibtex/biblatex:  map \"unpublished\" to \"speech\" if\n    the record contains
  \"eventtitle\", \"eventdate\", or \"venue\".\n    Otherwise map it to \"manuscript\"
  as before (#44).\n  * Look for chicago-author-date.csl in ~/.csl if no csl specified.\n
  \   If not found there, use the chicago-author-date.csl that comes with\n    the
  distribution (#48).\n  * Improved case transform behavior with punctuation.\n    Previously
  capitalization might change after a word-internal period\n    or apostrophe.  Now
  internal punctuation only signals a word\n    boundary if it is a dash or single
  quote character.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.3.1)\n\n  * Marked final heading (if present)
  as \"unnumbered\" (pandoc #1277).\n  * Treat empty 'references' (empty string) as
  empty list.\n  * Fixed titlecase transformation of words containing '.\n  * Fixed
  punctuation in notes.\n  * Improved test suite.\n  * FromJSON for Formatted: handle
  block lists as well as inline.\n  * Require yaml >= 0.8.8.2.\n  * Fixed spacing
  problem with citations in notes in footnote styles\n    (pandoc #1036).\n  * Updated
  chicago-author-date.csl and locales (#34).\n  * Move punctuation inside quotes,
  depending on style.  This is activated by\n    the `punctuation-in-quote` locale
  option, which has a default\n    per locale but can be overridden in the style.
  \ This gives more flexibility.\n    (Thanks to Jesse Rosenthal.)\n  * Moved `isPunctuationInQuote`
  to `Text.CSL.Style` and rewrote.\n    Previously it was in `Text.CSL.Output.Pandoc`.\n
  \   It doesn't need to use generics and no longer does.\n  * Fixed recognition of
  \"byzantine\" names.  Names with curly apostrophes were\n    being counted as non-byzantine,
  and printed given-first with no space\n    (#39).\n  * Fixed representation of reference
  types to conform to CSL (#24):\n    `motion_picture`, `legal_case`, `musical_score`,
  `personal_communication`.\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.3.0.1)\n\n  * Require ghc-prim if
  ghc < 7.6 (needed for generics).\n\npandoc-citeproc (0.3)\n\n  * Removed biblio2yaml.
  \ Instead, use pandoc-citeproc with the\n    --bib2yaml or --bib2json option.  (#20)\n
  \ * pandoc-citeproc --bib2json will convert bibtex/biblatex to\n    CSL compatible
  JSON bibliographies.\n  * Updated locale files for correct textual date ranges\n
  \   in e.g. the da-DK locale.  Use form=\"ordinal\" instead of a period\n    as
  suffix.  (#16, #18)\n  * Support new langid and langidopts biblatex fields. (#11)\n
  \ * Made test-pandoc-citeproc work in all locales. (#19)\n    It now tests the executable
  rather than the library function.\n  * Fixed disambiguation with multivolume works
  (#14).\n  * Improved titlecase/unTitlecase to be sensitive to colons,\n    question
  marks, and exclamation marks, after which the\n    next character sohuld be capitalized
  even in sentence case\n    (pandoc #1102).\n  * The \"locale\" filed in metadata
  will now override a style's\n    default locale.  This can also be set by the command
  line:\n    --metadata locale=fr-FR (#10).\n  * Use CSL-compatible date-parts for
  dates in YAML/JSON\n    bibliographies.\n  * Made FromJSON for Reference more forgiving.
  \ Suitable strings\n    are coerced into integer values.  (pandoc #1094)\n  * Fixed
  extra punctuation at end of footnote (#13).\n  * Reference:  Always use array in
  JSON for dates, agents.\n  * Bibtex parser:  Don't fail on entry with no title.\n
  \ * Bibliography output: 'given' is now a string, not an array.\n    The string
  will be split on spaces into a list of given names.\n    Note that an array can
  also be used.  But we write\n    a plain string, to match the  citeproc json schema.\n
  \ * Fixed spacing bug in date ranges (#7).\n  * Names:  Fixed formatLabel so it
  works for editortranslator.\n    This fixes a bug for cases where editor = translator
  (#9).\n  * Text.CSL.Eval.Date:  Fixed bugs with date ranges.\n    Ranges within
  the same year were raising an error \"Prelude.init: empty\n    list\" (#7).\n  *
  Util: Export tr' and init'.\n  * Text.CSL.Proc.Disamb:  Correct definition of allTheSame.\n
  \ * Improved disambiguation.  Now we correctly handle the case with no\n    author
  but title.\n  * Consider names too when determining date disambiguations.\n    Previously
  if you had two distinct names needing disambiguation for\n    the same date, the
  letters would not start over with 'a' for the second\n    name.\n  * Added Generic
  instances for the types in Style and Reference.\n"

  ===============


  This package provides a library and executable to facilitate the use of

  citeproc with pandoc 1.12 and greater.  (Earlier versions of pandoc have

  integrated citeproc support.)


  `pandoc-citeproc`

  -----------------


  The `pandoc-citeproc` executable can be used as a filter with pandoc to

  resolve and format citations using a bibliography file and a CSL

  stylesheet.  It can also be used (with `--bib2yaml` or `--bib2json`

  options) to convert a bibliography to a YAML format that can be put

  directly into a pandoc markdown document or to CSL JSON.  Bibliographies

  can be in any of several formats, but bibtex and biblatex are the best

  supported.


  For usage and further details, see the [pandoc-citeproc man

  page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md).


  The current version of the package includes code from citeproc-hs,

  which has not been updated for some time.  When citeproc-hs is brought

  up to date, this code can be removed and this package will depend

  on citeproc-hs.


  `Text.CSL.Pandoc`

  -----------------


  Those who use pandoc as a library (e.g. in a web application) will

  need to use this module to process citations.


  The module exports two functions, `processCites`, which is pure and

  accepts a style and a list of references as arguments, and

  `processCites''`, which lives in the IO monad and derives the style

  and references from the document''s metadata.
