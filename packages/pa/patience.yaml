  # patience


  ## About

  This library implements the "patience diff" algorithm, as well as the patience algorithm
  for the

  longest increasing subsequence problem.


  Patience diff computes the difference between two lists, for example the lines of
  two versions of

  a source file. It provides a good balance of performance, nice output for humans,
  and implementation

  simplicity. For more information, see these two blog posts: [alfedenzo](http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html),
