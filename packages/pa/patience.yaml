description: ! 'This library implements the \"patience diff\" algorithm, as well as
  the patience

  algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem.


  Patience diff computes the difference between two lists, for example the

  lines of two versions of a source file.  It provides a good balance of

  performance, nice output for humans, and implementation simplicity.  For more

  information, see <http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html> and

  <http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html>.


  New in version 0.1.1: relaxed @containers@ dependency, so it should build on

  GHC 6.10.'
