  # Changelog for password

  ## 1.0.0.0

  -   `hashPassWithSalt` has switched function arguments for better currying.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
      Although be warned that multiple passwords
      [should not be hashed with the same salt](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6#discussion_r370455681).
  -   Removed `Read` instance from `Pass` and added `Show` instance.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
      See [#5](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/5#issuecomment-576958351)
      for justification of this.
  -   `newSalt` is now `MonadIO m` instead of `IO`.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
  -   `PassCheckSucc` has been renamed to `PassCheckSuccess`.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
  -   Hide data constructor from `Pass` and add the `mkPass` function to construct a `Pass`.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
  -   Thanks to Felix Paulusma ([@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix)) for the above
      changes!
