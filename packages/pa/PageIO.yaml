description: ! 'This library provides an interface to the PageIn export format (.dux)
  from

  the StreamServe Persuasion(tm) platform, using it both as a data extraction

  as well as a page layout DSL.


  At the moment it''s extremely experimental, with no documentations and

  no examples, and as a whole may not make any sense except for existing

  users of StreamServe. :-)
