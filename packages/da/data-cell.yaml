description: ! 'This library defines a trivial type used for streaming

  of tabular data using coinductive control structures

  such as pipes, conduit or iteratees with a guaranteed

  constant memory usage.

  In this structure, each /cell/ of data is annotated

  with information about its relation to the following

  cell in the stream, namely /end of cell/, /end of row/

  and /end of table/ conditions. In addition, in order

  to achieve truly-constant memory usage irrespective of

  individual cell size, we allow individual cells to be

  subdivided further into /parts/, as indicated by the

  /end of part/ condition. Logically, this subdivision

  into parts is supposed to be purely operational and

  have no semantic significance, similarly to subdivision

  of lazy bytestrings into chunks.'
