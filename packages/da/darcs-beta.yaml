description: ! "Darcs\n=====\nThis is the source tree for darcs, a distributed version
  control system\nwritten in Haskell.\n\nFor more information, visit the darcs web
  site:\n\n   http://www.darcs.net\n\n\nCompilation and Installation\n============================\n\nBuilding
  Darcs requires GHC, version 6.10.3 or higher. It also requires the\nCabal package,
  version 1.6 or higher.  The cabal-install package is also\nrecommended.\n\nIf you
  have the \"cabal-install\" package on your system (that is, there is a\n\"cabal\"
  executable in your path), you can use the following command to create\nan executable
  in ~/.cabal/bin/darcs (this will also automatically fetch and\nbuild dependencies
  from the Hackage server).\n\n    $ cabal update\n    $ cabal install\n\nOtherwise,
  if you have the \"cabal\" package but not the \"cabal-install\"\npackage, run the
  following:\n\n    $ runghc Setup configure\n    $ runghc Setup build\n    $ sudo
  runghc Setup install\n\nYou may also omit the last step and copy the darcs executable
  (found in\ndist/build/darcs/darcs) to a location of your choosing.\n\nMore detailed
  instructions can be found at\n<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package>\nincluding
  instructions on obtaining a copy of cabal-install.\n\nPlease also note that the
  cabal-based build by default requires the cURL\nlibrary (and development headers).
  If, for some reason, you cannot provide\ncURL, please pass \"-f-curl\" to the configure
  step above.\n\n\nHacking\n=======\nFor more information about darcs hacking and
  best practices please check\nthe darcs wiki at http://wiki.darcs.net\n\nOf particular
  interest are the following documents:\n  * http://wiki.darcs.net/Development/GettingStarted\n
  \ * http://wiki.darcs.net/Development/FAQ\n\nComments about do-notation warnings\n===================================\nYou
  may find a number of comments (163 of them at the time of writing) looking\nlike:\n--
  Warning:  A do-notation statement discarded a result of type Whatever.\nThey signal
  warnings issued by GHC that have been automatically silenced.\nSee http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1988
  for more detail.\n\nThese warnings were most certainly harmless, but who knows...
  If you stumble\nupon one such comment, take a minute or two to check if it is really
  okay to\nignore the return value (look for \"_ <- \" on the line next to the comment).
  \ If\neverything is correct, please remove the comment and send a patch (mentioning\nissue1988).
  \ If it isn't, you have found a bug, congratulations!  Fix it, or\nfill a bug report
  on http//bugs.darcs.net/.  Finally, if in doubt, leave it as\nis.  Many thanks.\n\nTesting\n=======\nFor
  more information about the test suite, including how to run specific\ntests please
  read tests/README.test_maintainers.txt.\n\nHappy hacking!\n"
