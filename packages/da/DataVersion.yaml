  # DataMigration

  Type safe data migrations.

  All you need to do is create a type family to index your record and
  provide an instance of `Transform` to migrate your data between
  versions.

  Migrations are type-safe and the library uses generics to remove as
  much boiler-plate as possible.

  ## Future Considerations

  In the future this library will provide a high-level DSL to enable
  better ergonomics around type errors so that you can see which fields
  require specification in the migration.
