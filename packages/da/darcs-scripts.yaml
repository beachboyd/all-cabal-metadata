description: ! 'This is a collection of Bash shell scripts

  for support of development using the revision control system Darcs.

  The scripts are installed in your @cabal/share@ directory,

  thus you may extend your command search path accordingly.


  Within a Darcs working copy you may run:


  * @editor \`darcs-list-modified\`@:

  Open an editor with all files that are modified

  with respect to the current local repository state.


  * @darcs-replace-rec OLD NEW dirOrFileA dirOrFileB@:

  Replace @OLD@ by @NEW@ in all files in @dirOrFileA@ and so on,

  that contain @OLD@.

  This calls @darcs replace@, that is,

  the replacements are managed by Darcs as such.


  * @darcs-mv-hs src\/Data\/Special.hs src\/Control\/Extra.hs@:

  Move the file @src\/Data\/Special.hs@ to @src\/Control\/Extra.hs@

  and replace the according module name

  @Data.Special@ by @Control.Extra@

  in all modules in directory @src@ and in the cabal file.

  The first component must be a directory for source files.

  If you do not have a source directory, you may use @.@,

  but then files in @_darcs@ are also addressed,

  and Darcs will warn you.

  Nested source directories are not supported.


  * @darcs-hub-put pkgname@:

  Create new darcs repository at hub.darcs.net

  with the Cabal Synopsis as repository summary.

  The push patches to the newly created repository.

  @pkgname@ is the name of the remote repository.

  A common way to run the script is @darcs-hub-put \`basename $PWD\`@.


  * @darcs-conv-latin-to-utf8 dirOrFile ...@:

  Convert all files from Latin encoding to UTF8 encoding.

  You may easily adapt the script in order

  to convert between other encodings.

  Instead of using non-ASCII encodings

  you may replace non-ASCII symbols by Haskell string escape codes.


  * @darcs-replace-finitemap@:

  Convert old programs from use of @FiniteMap@ to @containers:Data.Map@.


  * @darcs-mv-m3@ and @darcs-mv-mg@ are for Modula-3 development.

  They rename both interface and implementation file of a module

  and replace module names accordingly.'
