description: ! 'A simple library, which contains an interface for generating fresh
  values.


  This library also includes two functor transformers which implement this

  interface. They consume fresh values from user-supplied comonads.

  Currently, two approaches are implemented:


  * In @Stream@, the comonad provides a way to succeed a value.


  * In @Delta@, the comonad provides a way to split the value or to succeeded

  it. The benefit is that the underlying functor doesn''t need to be a monad.'
