description: ! '

  A catalogue of the combinator birds (Data.Aviary.Birds etc.) -

  these modules are intended for illustration and-or reference

  (i.e. looking up combinators by their type signature).


  Using @Data.Aviary@ as a library (i.e. depending on it for

  other packages) is not recommended: combinator-mania leads to

  inscrutable code.



  Changelog


  v0.4.0:


  * Removed the \"useful\" combinators (to emphasize that

  Data.Aviary is not a utility library).


  * Fixed typos in Haddock docs - thanks to Christopher Young for

  spotting them.


  v0.3.0:


  * Added Monadic variations.


  v0.2.3:


  * Added Data.Aviary.BirdsVersion - same as the original Birds

  module, but with type signatures following a revised naming

  scheme.


  v0.2.2:


  * Added Data.Aviary.Functional - the Applicative, Monad etc.

  combinatorswith implementations and signatures specialized to

  the (simple) functional type cf. the Reader monad.


  v0.2.1:


  * Added @dup@ and the /combiner/ variants of cardinal-prime.


  v0.2.0:


  * Added Haddock docs for @(\#\#)@.'
