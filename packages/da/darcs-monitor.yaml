description: ! "                            darcs-monitor\n                            -------------\n\nDarcs-monitor
  sends email to a specified recipient about every patch\nin the repository that it
  has not sent mail about yet.  It can be run from\nCron or as a darcs apply posthook,
  whichever fits best your needs.\n\nIt ought not be too hard to extend it for other
  kinds of notification than\njust emails; but no others are implemented at this time.\n\nThere
  is a DarcsWiki page on darcs-monitor at\n  http://wiki.darcs.net/RelatedSoftware/DarcsMonitor\n\n\n
  \                            Installation\n\nDarcs-monitor depends on mtl and HaXml.
  \ First, make sure they are\ninstalled.\n\nDarcs-monitor is Cabalised.  The standard
  incantations\n\n   runhaskell Setup.hs configure\n   runhaskell Setup.hs build\n
  \  runhaskell Setup.hs install\n\nought to work for most people.\n\nDarcs-monitor
  has been tested using GHC 6.12.1.  It might not work with\nolder compilers; though
  patches are accepted for fixing any\nunportabilities.\n\n\n                                Usage\n\nIn
  the following, I assume that the repository you want to monitor is\nin directory
  $REPO.\n\nTo have darcs-monitor run every time someone pushes to the repository,\ncreate
  the file $REPO/_darcs/prefs/defaults with the following content:\n\n8<-- cut here
  --\napply posthook darcs-monitor --charset=CHARSET email RECIPIENT [email RECIPIENT
  ...]\napply run-posthook\n8<-- cut here\n\nIn the above, CHARSET should be the MIME
  charset that patches\n(including their metadata) are in, and RECIPIENT should be
  the email\naddress where emails should be sent. You can specify more than one recipient\nby
  repeating the email parameter. Also, if darcs-monitor is not\ninstalled in the default
  $PATH, you should specify th full path to the\ndarcs-monitor binary.\n\nYou can
  also run darcs-monitor from Cron or from the command line.  In\nthose cases, it
  is easiest to specify the path to the repository on\nthe command line after other
  arguments.  In fact, you can specify more\nthan one.\n\nBy default, mail is sent
  by calling /usr/sbin/sendmail.  Another sendmail\nbinary can be specified by using
  a command-line switch.\n\nYou can customise the email by providing a template.  The
  default one\nis installed in the Cabal-specified datadir as \"default-template\".\nYou
  should put your own template in the file\n$REPO/_darcs/third-party/darcs-monitor/email-template\n(you
  can use other files, but then you have to specify where it is).\n\nIn the template
  you can use the following substitutions:\n  %RECIPIENT%   -- the email address to
  which email is sent\n  %DIFF%        -- the Darcs-provided diff -u of the patch\n
  \ %CHANGES%     -- a Darcs-provided summary of changes\n  %REPO%        -- the path
  to the repository\n  %SHORTREPO%   -- the final component of the path to the repository\n
  \ %AUTHOR%      -- the patch author\n  %DATE%        -- the patch date\n  %HASH%
  \       -- the patch Darcs hash\n  %TITLE%       -- the patch name\n  %COMMENT%
  \    -- the patch comment\n\nAlso, in the template, two percent signs in sequence
  (%%) start a comment\nthat extends to the end of the current line.\n\n\n                                Thanks\n\nThe
  following people, in addition to myself, have contributed code to\nthis program:\n\n
  \ Benja Fallenstein\n  Benjamin Franksen\n\nMy thanks to them.\n\n\n                               Feedback\n\nPlease
  send comments and bug reports to marcot@marcot.eti.br.\n\nAny patches should be
  prepared with Darcs against the repository\n  http://marcot.eti.br/darcs/darcs-monitor/\nand
  sent using \"darcs send\".\n\nHave fun,\n\n\nAntti-Juhani Kaijanaho\n"
