description: ! "data-or\n=======\n\nThis is a simple package and should be easy to
  install. You should\nbe able to use one of the following standard methods to install
  it.\n\n    -- With cabal-install and without the source:\n    $> cabal install data-or\n
  \   \n    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:\n    $> cd data-or\n
  \   $> cabal install\n    \n    -- Without cabal-install, but with the source already:\n
  \   $> cd data-or\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user\n    $> runhaskell
  Setup.hs build\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock
  --hyperlink-source\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  register\n\nThe test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock\nstep
  is also optional.\n\n\nPortability\n===========\n\nAn attempt has been made to keep
  this library as portable as possible.\nIt is Haskell98 except for the use of CPP,
  which allows some functions\nto be good producers for list fusion in GHC.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
