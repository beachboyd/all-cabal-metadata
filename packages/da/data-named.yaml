  Data-named
  ==========

  The library provides data types which can be used to represent forest
  structures with labels stored in internal nodes and words kept in leaves.
  In particular, those types are well suited for representing the layer of named
  entities (NEs).

  The IOB method is implemented in the `Data.Named.IOB` module and can be used to
  translate between a forest of entities and a sequence of compound IOB labels.
  This method can be used together with a sequence classifier to indirectly model
  forest structures.

  The `Data.Named.Graph` module can be used to represent more general, graph
  structures of entities.  The module provides also a lossy conversion from a DAG
  to a disjoint forest of entities.
