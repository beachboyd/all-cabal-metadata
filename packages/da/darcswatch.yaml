description: ! "darcswatch\n\nÂ© 2008-2010 Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>\n\nThis
  program tracks darcs patches and repositories, giving\nan overview over their state
  (applied or not applied).\n\nThe patches are expected to come in via the mailfilter.sh\nprogram,
  which stores the patches in the appropriate place.\n\nThe main program then downloads
  the repository inventories\nand compares the mailed patches against the repository.
  It\nsummaries their status per submitter and per repository.\n\nThe program expects
  a directory as a parameter and will read\nthe config file therein for configuration.
  An example\nconfiguration is included.\n\nDarcsWatch uses modules from these non-standard
  packages:\n * xhtml\n * network\n * HTTP\n * Crypto\n * parsec\n * nano-md5\n *
  zlib\n * concurrentoutput\n * time\n * mime-string\n * regex-compat\n\nThere are
  a lot of open issues, and help is very\nappreciated. A non exclusive list of TODO
  items is:\n\n * Nicer output (CSS magic!)\n * (Maybe) Add repositories per GnuPG
  signed command\n\nWhen committing patches, please make sure that they work with\nthe
  version of GHC in the latest Debian stable release, at\nthe moment ghc6.6, and compatible
  libraries.\n\nBTW, the simple darcs repository parsing code might be useful for\nother
  projects as well. I try to keep the patches for the Darcs.hs\nrelated stuff separate
  from the rest, so you can select them when\n\"darcs pull\"ing. If you also follow
  this procedure, we can share the\nDarcs.hs code between projects, by making sure
  our patches to these\nfiles can be shared without dragging in the rest of the project.\n"
