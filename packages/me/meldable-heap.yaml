synopsis: Asymptotically optimal, Coq-verified meldable heaps, AKA priority queues
changelog: ! "Changes in version 2.0.3:\n==========================================\n\n*
  Fixed export order in Strict to match that in Lazy and MeldableHeap.\n\nChanges
  in version 2.0.2:\n==========================================\n\n* Added link to
  CHANGELOG in cabal description\n\nChanges in version 2.0.1:\n==========================================\n\n*
  Added examples to Haddock documentation\n* Added this CHANGELOG\n\nChanges in version
  2.0:\n==========================================\n\n* Added a strict and a lazy
  version\n\nChanges in version 1.1.2:\n==========================================\n\n*
  Moved proof files from \"extra-source-files\" to \"data-files\" in cabal configuration\n\nChanges
  in version 1.1.1:\n==========================================\n\n* Change definition
  of meld to avoid use of Coq's \"Function\" feature, relying on higher-order fixpoints
  instead. \n  The Coq manual calls \"Function\" experimental.\n\nChanges in version
  1.1:\n==========================================\n\n* Remove some unused parts of
  Coq files\n* Change type parameter order of heap type to make it usable in contexts
  requiring kind * -> *\n"

description: ! 'A heap is a container supporting the insertion of elements and the
  extraction of the minimum element. This library additionally supports melding two
  heaps. This library models the implementation of asymptotically optimal purely functional
  heaps given by Brodal and Okasaki in their paper \"Optimal Purely Functional Priority
  Queues\". It has been proved correct using the Coq proof assistant. The proofs are
  included in the Cabal package.
