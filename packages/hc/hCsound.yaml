description: ! "hCsound - Haskell interface to the Csound API.\n\nEnable control of
  Csound from the Haskell language.\n\nRequirements: a haskell compiler (currently
  tested with GHC 6.10.x) and a working Csound installation (Csound >= 5.08 && <=
  6.0).\n\nBuilding:\nIn the simplest case, this program can be built in the standard
  cabal manner, as below:\n        > cabal configure -O2\n        > cabal build\n
  \       > cabal install\n\nThe default is to build against 64-bit csound.  The flag
  useDouble controls whether the library is built against 32-bit or 64-bit csound.
  \ Disable this flag (with -f-useDouble) to link to 32-bit csound.\n\nInstalling
  on Unix/Linux: if Csound is in a non-standard location, you may need to specify
  the location during the configure step.\n        > cabal configure -O2 --extra-include-dirs=\"/path/to/headers\"
  --extra-lib-dirs=\"/path/to/libs\"\n\nInstalling on Windows: hCsound has been successfully
  built on Windows, but I have frequently had problems with the linker included in
  GHC and the csound DLL.  Your best bet is to use MinGW.  Please contact the hCsound
  maintainer for further assistance.\n\nInstalling on Mac: if Csound was installed
  using the mac installer, hCsound will link to the installed frameworks.  If you
  have self-compiled csound and installed to a non-standard location (i.e. other than
  /Libraries/Frameworks/CsoundLib.framework and /Libraries/Frameworks/CsoundLib64.framework),
  use the flag -f-useFramework to disable linking to the frameworks.  In this case
  you will need to specify the header and library paths using --extra-include-dirs
  and --extra-lib-dirs if they aren't in the default locations.\n example:\n        >
  cabal configure -O2 -f-useFramework --extra-include-dirs=\"/path/to/headers\" --extra-lib-dirs=\"/path/to/libs\"\n"
