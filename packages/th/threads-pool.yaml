description: ! 'This library allows you to create a pool of worker threads,

  give them tasks using a queue and receive results. Or not receive,

  if you wan''t to. Tasks are monadic computations in any monad which

  belong to special ''Task'' typeclass (it basically means that one can

  run that computation in IO monad, using some argument).'
