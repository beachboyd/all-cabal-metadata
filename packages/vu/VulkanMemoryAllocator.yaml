  # VulkanMemoryAllocator

  Slightly high level Haskell bindings to the [Vulkan Memory
  Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
  library.

  These bindings are intended to be imported qualified and do not feature the
  `Vma` prefixes on commands, structures or constants.

  This builds on the [vulkan
  Package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vulkan). It uses the same method
  of generating slightly-high-level bindings, see the [vulkan
  readme](../readme.md) for more info.
