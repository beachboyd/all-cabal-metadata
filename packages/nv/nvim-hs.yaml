synopsis: Haskell plugin backend for neovim
changelog: ! "# 1.0.0.0\n\n* Each plugin (type) now defines an environment which is
  similar to how\n  stateful plugins have been declared in previous versions. If you
  need\n  multiple different environments for different functions, you can make them\n
  \ fields of a bigger environment or define multiple plugin values.\n\n  The type
  `Neovim r st a` has become `Neovim env a` where `env` is\n  technically equivalent
  to the previous `r`.\n  I was mainly motivated by this blog post:\n\n  https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern\n\n*
  Only works with ghc >= 8. I removed some backwards compatibility. If you\n  need
  older ghc versions, just use the previous version (0.2.5) as the\n  feature set
  hasn't really changed.\n\n* A different pretty printer library is now used and may
  surface at some\n  places.\n\n* Functions do now time out after some time, 10 seconds
  for those that block\n  neovim and 10 minutes for background functions.\n\n* A few
  types have been adjusted.\n\n* Some improvement in error reporting.\n\n# 0.2.5\n\n*
  Older versions of `nvim-hs` may not function if some versions of a\n  dependency
  are used. This version has proper bounds for the dependency and\n  should cause
  a compile time failure if an incompatible version of the\n  dependency is used (see
  #61).\n\n# 0.2.0\n\n* Replace error code of remote functions to return\n  `Either
  NeovimException a` instead of a generic messagepack `Object`\n\n* Export API functions
  that throw a `NeovimException` instead of returning\n  `Either NeovimExeception
  a`.\n\n* Replace three element tuple for stateful function declaration (#53)\n\n*
  Add a stack template for easier setup\n\n* Exceptions from pure code are now caught
  (#48)\n\n# 0.1.0\n\n* Adjust parser for output of `nvim --api-info`\n\n* Adjust
  parser of ConfigHelper plugin\n\n# 0.0.7\n\n* Adjust handling of string sent by
  neovim in API generation.\n\n# 0.0.6\n\n* Noteworthy new API functions for the user's
  convenience:\n\n  - `errOnInvalidResult`\n  - `(:+)`\n\n* ansi-wl-pprint is used
  for pretty printing of various things now. Most\n  notably, the error type has been
  changed from `String` to `Doc`.\n  This is a breaking change, but it was kind of
  announced in the issues\n  list. In any case, uses of `err` can be fixed by enabling
  the\n  `OverloadedStrings` extension. Other breakages have to be fixed by hand.\n\n#
  0.0.5\n\n* Documentation received some love.\n\n* A few renames of repurposed internals.\n\n#
  0.0.3\n\n* Debugging facilities for ghci have been added. Check out the\n  `Neovim.Debug`
  module! These few functions are very valuable to debug your\n  code or even the
  code of nvim-hs itself.\n\n* Startup code now has a special `Neovim` environment
  which has access to\n  some of the internals that may or may not be useful. This
  change allowed\n  the ConfigHelper plugin to be included as a normal, separable
  plugin.\n  Unfortunately, this potentially breaks the plugin startup code of some\n
  \ existing plugins.\n\n* Neovim context is no longer a type synonym, but a newtype
  wrapper around\n  the previous type synonym with an added `ResourceT` wrapper. The
  functions\n  from `MonadReader` are now actually exported as those.\n\n  As a consequence,
  some of your code may break if you lack some specific\n  instances which were auto-derived
  before. Send a PR or open a ticket to\n  resolve this.\n\n* Add handling for some
  kind of variadic arguments handling.\n\n  A command or function will be passed `Nothing`
  as it's\n  last arguments if the argument type is wrapped in `Maybe`\n  and the
  invocation on the side of neovim did not pass those\n  arguments.\n\n# 0.0.2\n\n*
  Add handling for special command options\n\n  This breaks code that used `command`
  or `command'` to export\n  functionality. You should replace the options with a
  list\n  of `CommandOptions`.\n\n  An export like `$(command' foo) def { cmdSync
  = Async }` must be redefined\n  to `$(command' foo) [CmdSync Async]`.\n\n# 0.0.1\n\n*
  Usable prototype implementation\n"

description: ! "# nvim-hs\n\nNeovim API for Haskell plugins as well as a plugin provider.\nThis
  library and executable should provide a basis for developing\nplugins. This package
  should only contain broadly useful interfaces\nto write plugins for neovim in haskell.
  The design goal is to create\nan easy to use API that avoids most of the boilerplate
  while still retaining\nsome sense of reliability and type safety. Since Template
  Haskell is used\nto generate the neovim bindings and to avoid some of the boilerplate\nhandy
  work, some exotic operating systems and architectures may not work.\n\n[![Build

  What do I have to expect if I were to use it now?\n\nCheck the issue list here on
  github.\n\n# How do I start using this?\n\nFirst, you have to decide how you want
  to manage your plugins. Every section\nof this chapter describes an alternative
  way to manage your plugins. It\nstarts with a list of pros and cons and then explains
  what you have to do to\nget rolling and how you would install a `nvim-hs`-compatible
  plguin. The\ngeneral library documentation is in the haddocks on\n([hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvim-hs-0.2.0/docs/Neovim.html)).\nIf
  you are new to Haskell development or you don't really care how you manage\nyour
  plugins, I (saep) recommend the stack template approach.\n\n## Stack via the template\n\n###
  Pros\n\n- Easy to setup because of the template\n- Flexible dependency management;
  everything that stack supports can be done, this\n  includes packages on stackage,
  packages on hackage, local packages and repositories\n- Reprobucible; if it works
  once, it will work in the future\n- If you don't use stack just for neovim plugins
  and you have other projects with the\n  same (or a similiar) lts (long term support)
  version, you save compilation time on the\n  initial setup\n\n### Cons\n\n- A bit
  verbose; you have to add dependencies twice if they are not in the stackage snapshot\n\n###
  Installation\n\nFirst, you must [install stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).\n\nYou
  have to have installed neovim and the executable `nvim` must be on the path.\n(The
  API code generation calls `nvim --api-info`.)\n\nAfterwards, you switch to your
  neovim configuration folder (typically `~/.config/nvim`) and\nyou have to create
  your plugin project.\n\n> cd ~/.config/nvim\n\n> stack new my-nvim-hs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs/master/stack-template.hsfiles
  --bare --omit-packages --ignore-subdirs\n\nNow, you have to compile everything.\n\n>
  stack setup\n\n> stack build\n\nIf there are no errors (there shouldn't be any),
  you only have to tell neovim how to start this.\nAdd the following to your `init.vim`:\n\n```vimL\nif
  has('nvim') \" This way, you can also put this in your plain vim config\n\n\t\"
  function which starts a nvim-hs instance with the supplied name\n\tfunction! s:RequireHaskellHost(name)\n\t\t\"
  It is important that the current working directory (cwd) is where\n\t\t\" your configuration
  files are.\n\t\treturn jobstart(['stack', 'exec', 'nvim-hs', a:name.name], {'rpc':
  v:true, 'cwd': expand('$HOME') . '/.config/nvim'})\n\tendfunction\n\n\t\" Register
  a plugin host that is started when a haskell file is opened\n\tcall remote#host#Register('haskell',
  \"*.l\\?hs\", function('s:RequireHaskellHost'))\n\n\t\" But if you need it for other
  files as well, you may just start it\n\t\" forcefully by requiring it\n\tlet hc=remote#host#Require('haskell')\nendif\n```\n\nIf
  you start neovim now, you can use the predefined functions from the template.\n\n>
  :echo NextRandom()\n\nshould print a random number.\n\n### Installing a plugin from
  Hackage\n\nLet's take [nvim-hs-ghcid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvim-hs-ghcid)\nas
  an example. Let's also pretend, that it's not on stackage. \nWe have to declare
  the dependency\nin the `my-nvim-hs.cabal` file and in the `stack.yaml` file. In
  the `.cabal`\nfile, add `nvim-hs-ghcid` to the `build-depends` section. It should
  look\nlike this:\n\n```cabal\n  build-depends:       base >= 4.7 && < 5\n                     ,
  nvim-hs >= 0.2.0 && < 1.0.0\n                     , nvim-hs-ghcid\n```\n\nYou can
  omit the version number, since you will have to define it in the\n`stack.yaml` file
  and you are managing you dependencies with stack anyways.\nThe `extra-deps` section
  of the `stack.yaml` should look like this:\n\n```yaml\nextra-deps:\n- nvim-hs-ghcid-0.2.0\n```\n\nIf
  `nvim-hs-ghcid` depended upon any other package that is not on stackage,\nyou would
  have to add those dependencies there as well. The output of \n`stack build` should
  tell you which you have to add. You don't have to add\nthese transitive dependencies
  to the `build-depends` of the cabal file because\nyou are not accessing anything
  from these packages directly.\n\nAdding all these explicit versions seems to be
  the disadvantage of using stack. \nHowever, the benefit is that you will have a\nreproducible
  build in the future and you don't have to hunt down a working\nset of version boundaries
  for every dependency you have. A little effort now\nwill save you more time later!\n\nTo
  use the plugin, add it to the plugins list of the `nvim.hs` file in\n`~/.config/nvim`:\n\n```haskell\nimport
  Neovim\n\nimport qualified Neovim.Example.Plugin as Example\nimport qualified Neovim.Ghcid
  as Ghcid\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    neovim defaultConfig\n        { plugins
  = plugins defaultConfig ++\n            [ Example.plugin\n            , Ghcid.plugin\n
  \           ]\n        }\n```\n\nIf you want to update a dependency/plugin,\nyou
  have to manually increment the version number in the stack.yaml file and\npossibly
  fix the compilation errors that arise. If you want a rolling\nrelease for a plugin,
  follow the instructions for installing a plugin from\ngit.\n\n### Installing a plugin
  from git\n\nThis method is best suited for plugins that update a lot and for which
  you need\nthe most recent version most of the time. This also works for plugins
  that do not\nhave a hackage release. If you don't intend to work on the\ncode of
  that plugin repository, you can add it to the plugin list of your\nplugin manager
  (e.g. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)). \nThis way, you get updates
  if you update all your normal vim plugins.\nTo stay with the example of the previous
  section, we use the `nvim-hs-ghcid`\nplugin again.\n\nAdd the plugin to your plugin
  manager (here with vim-plug as an example):\n\n```vimL\nPlug 'saep/nvim-hs-ghcid',
  { 'for': ['haskell'] }\n```\n\nOnce vim-plug has cloned or updated the repository,
  add the plugin to the\npackages list of the `stackage.yaml` file. The packages list
  should look\nlike this:\n\n```yaml\npackages:\n- .\n- plugged/nvim-hs-ghcid # or
  the appropriate relative path the folder you configured\n```\n\nAs long as you have
  the repository in this list, you don't have to specify\nit as a dependency  anywhere
  else, you still have to add the plugins'\ndependencies to the `stack.yaml` file,
  though. It chould look like this:\n\n```yaml\nextra-deps:\n- some-dependency-0.2.4\n-
  and-another-one-13.8.5.2\n```\n\nAdd the plugin to the plugins list in `nvim.hs`
  in exactly the same way as\ndescribed at the end of the previous chapter.\n\nThe
  downside of this approach is that your compilation times will be longer the more\nplugins
  you include this way. \n\n### Writing your own functions that you can call from
  neovim\n\nThe stack template generated a few files for you that you can use as a\ntemplate
  to write your own plugins. If you edit them and make a mistake that\nthe Haskell
  compiler can detect, an item in the quickfix list should appear.\nThis is, unless
  you removed `plugins defaultConfig` from `nvim.hs`.\n\n# Contributing\n\nDocumentation,
  typo fixes and alike will almost always be merged.\n\nIf you want to bring forward
  new features or convenience libraries\nfor interacting with neovim, you should create
  an issue first. The features\nof this (cabal) project should be kept small as this
  helps\nreducing the development time. (For some tests it is\nnecessary to issue
  `cabal install`, so any change to to a module can\nsignificantly increase the compilation
  time.)\nIf your idea solves a general problem, feel free to open an issue in the\nlibrary
  project of nvim-hs:\n[nvim-hs-contrib](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs-contrib)\n\n"
