description: ! 'Binary parsing with random access. The target file to be

  parsed is loaded into memory at the start (represented as

  an IOUArray Int Word8). Parsing proceeds by moving a cursor

  around, the array is left intact. This allows _jumping_

  inside the file and contrasts with other parser

  combinators that progress via consuming input.


  \* Caveat \* - the above of course means that the target file

  is obliged to be small enough to fit into memory.


  \*\* MAJOR CAVEAT \*\* - kangaroo is somewhat half-baked (maybe

  now two thirds baked). The parsing machinery seems good but the

  combinators need more work. It\''s on Hackage because I''m using

  it with Hurdle which was already on Hackage and the techinique

  of moving a cursor rather than consuming input seems at least

  interesting.


  Currently kangaroo is twinned with its own library of formatting

  combinators (JoinPrint), at some point this is may go in its a

  separate package.


  Changelog:


  0.4.0 Changed JoinPrint to have distinct types for single-line

  documents (Doc) and multi-line documents (VDoc). This is

  because single-line docs track their horizontal length.


  Added a ''skip'' primitive to the Parse Monad. Added ''local'' and

  ''asks'' to the Reader top-level modules.


  0.3.0 Documented the primitive parsers. @char@ renamed @anyChar@

  to match Parsec\''s convention. Rationalized exports from

  ParseMonad module.


  0.2.0 Changes to ParseMonad - parsing within a region simplified,

  temporarily added JoinPrint.


  0.1.0 First version.
