description: ! 'Unofficial CLI client for the Kattis online judge system (currently
  in BETA).


  Written in a git-like fashion, it supports automatic

  downloading of test cases, easy submissions, and more.


  Basically a problem is initialized as follows

  (creates a directory and downloads any available test cases):


  > > katt init hello

  > > cd hello


  Source files, problem names, and language identification is handled

  automatically when submitting solutions:


  > > vim hello.java

  > > katt submit

  > Made submission 4712

  > Accepted: 1 of 1 test(s) passed


  There is also built-in support for problem sessions,

  which initalizes all problems in the problem list.


  Get started by downloading a /.kattisrc/ config from

  the official site, make sure you have the haskell platform

  installed, then run /cabal install katt/.


  Please note that the beta release is limited to C, C++, Java, and Haskell.

  It also only supports running on unix.


  Changes since last release:


  * Support for Haskell submissions


  * HTTP client replaced with wreq


  * Improved code readability'
