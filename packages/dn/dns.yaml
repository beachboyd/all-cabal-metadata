synopsis: DNS library in Haskell
changelog: ! '# 3.0.3


  - Implementing NSEC3PARAM [#109](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/109)

  - Fixing an example of DNS server.

  - Improving DNS decoder [#111](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/111)


  # 3.0.2


  - Supporting conduit 1.3 [#105](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/105)

  - Supporting GHC 8.4 with semigroup hack.


  # 3.0.1


  - Supporting GHC 7.8 again.


  # 3.0.0


  - The version introduces some breaking changes internally. But upper layer APIs
  in the `Lookup` module remain the same.

  - Breaking change: `Network.DNS.Types` is redesigned. `ResourceRecord` is not a
  sum type anymore. It holds only normal RRs. For EDNS0, a new scheme is implemented.
  [#63](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/issues/63)

  - Breaking change: the `Encode` and `Decode` modules use strict ByteString instead
  of lazy one. [#59](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/issues/59)

  - Default DNS servers are detected automatically on Windows if `RCFilePath` is used.
  Use vanilla `defaultResolvConf` on Windows! [#83](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/83)

  - Multiple DNS servers can be used. You can choose either sequential lookup or concurrent
  lookup. See `resolvConcurrent`. [#81](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/81)

  - EDNS0 queries are used by default. [#95](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/95)

  - `lookupSOA` is defined. [#93](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/dns/pull/93)

  - Cache mechanism is provided. See `resolvCache`.

  - Some constructors such as ANY are added in the `Types` module.

  - Some bug fixes and code clean-up.
