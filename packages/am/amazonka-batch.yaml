  ## Version


  `1.6.0`



  ## Description


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-batch)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information, sending requests,

  and receiving responses.


  Lenses are used for constructing and manipulating types,

  due to the depth of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).


  See [Network.AWS.Batch](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-batch/docs/Network-AWS-Batch.html)

  or [the AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) to get started.
