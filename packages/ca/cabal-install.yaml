changelog: ! "-*-change-log-*-\n\n2.0.0.1 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com>
  December 2017\n\t* Support for GHC's numeric -g debug levels (#4673).\n\t* Demoted
  'scope' field version check to a warning (#4714).\n\t* Fixed verbosity flags getting
  removed before being passed to\n\t'printPlan' (#4724).\n\t* Added a '--store-dir'
  option that can be used to configure the\n\tlocation of the build global build store
  (#4623).\n\t* Turned `allow-{newer,older}` in `cabal.project` files into an\n\taccumulating
  field to match CLI flag semantics (#4679).\n\t* Improve success message when `cabal
  upload`ing documentation\n\t(#4777).\n\t* Documentation fixes.\n\n2.0.0.0 Mikhail
  Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> August 2017\n\t* See http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2017-09-09-Cabal-2-0.html\n\tfor
  more detailed release notes.\n\t* Removed the '--root-cmd' parameter of the 'install'
  command\n\t(#3356).\n\t* Deprecated 'cabal install --global' (#3356).\n\t* Changed
  'cabal upload' to upload a package candidate by default\n\t(#3419). Same applies
  to uploading documentation.\n\t* Added a new 'cabal upload' flag '--publish' for
  publishing a\n\tpackage on Hackage instead of uploading a candidate (#3419).\n\t*
  Added optional solver output visualisation support via the\n\ttracetree package.
  Mainly intended for debugging (#3410).\n\t* Removed the '--check' option from 'cabal
  upload'\n\t(#1823). It was replaced by package candidates.\n\t* Fixed various behaviour
  differences between network transports\n\t(#3429).\n\t* The bootstrap script now
  works correctly when run from a Git\n\tclone (#3439).\n\t* Removed the top-down
  solver (#3598).\n\t* The '-v/--verbosity' option no longer affects GHC verbosity\n\t(except
  in the case of '-v0'). Use '--ghc-options=-v' to enable\n\tverbose GHC output (#3540,
  #3671).\n\t* Changed the default logfile template from\n\t'.../$pkgid.log' to '.../$compiler/$libname.log'
  (#3807).\n\t* Added a new command, 'cabal reconfigure', which re-runs 'configure'\n\twith
  the most recently used flags (#2214).\n\t* Added the '--index-state' flag for requesting
  a specific\n\tversion of the package index (#3893, #4115).\n\t* Support for building
  Backpack packages.  See\n\thttps://github.com/ezyang/ghc-proposals/blob/backpack/proposals/0000-backpack.rst\n\tfor
  more details.\n\t* Support the Nix package manager (#3651).\n\t* Made the 'template-haskell'
  package non-upgradable again (#4185).\n\t* Fixed password echoing on MinTTY (#4128).\n\t*
  Added a new solver flag, '--allow-boot-library-installs', that allows\n\tany package
  to be installed or upgraded (#4209).\n\t* New 'cabal-install' command: 'outdated',
  for listing outdated\n\tversion bounds in a .cabal file or a freeze file (#4207).\n\t*
  Added qualified constraints for setup dependencies. For example,\n\t--constraint=\"setup.bar
  == 1.0\" constrains all setup dependencies on\n\tbar, and --constraint=\"foo:setup.bar
  == 1.0\" constrains foo's setup\n\tdependency on bar (part of #3502).\n\t* Non-qualified
  constraints, such as --constraint=\"bar == 1.0\", now\n\tonly apply to top-level
  dependencies. They don't constrain setup or\n\tbuild-tool dependencies. The new
  syntax --constraint=\"any.bar == 1.0\"\n\tconstrains all uses of bar.\n\t* Added
  a technical preview version of the 'cabal doctest' command\n\t(#4480).\n\n1.24.0.2
  Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> December 2016\n\t* Adapted to
  the revert of a PVP-noncompliant API change in\n\tCabal 1.24.2.0 (#4123).\n\t* Bumped
  the directory upper bound to < 1.4 (#4158).\n\n1.24.0.1 Ryan Thomas <ryan@ryant.org>
  October 2016\n\t* Fixed issue with passing '--enable-profiling' when invoking\n\tSetup
  scripts built with older versions of Cabal (#3873).\n\t* Fixed various behaviour
  differences between network transports\n\t(#3429).\n\t* Updated to depend on the
  latest hackage-security that fixes\n\tvarious issues on Windows.\n\t* Fixed 'new-build'
  to exit with a non-zero exit code on failure\n\t(#3506).\n\t* Store secure repo
  index data as 01-index.* (#3862).\n\t* Added new hackage-security root keys for
  distribution with\n\tcabal-install.\n\t* Fix an issue where 'cabal install' sometimes
  had to be run twice\n\tfor packages with build-type: Custom and a custom-setup stanza\n\t(#3723).\n\t*
  'cabal sdist' no longer ignores '--builddir' when the package's\n\tbuild-type is
  Custom (#3794).\n\n1.24.0.0 Ryan Thomas <ryan@ryant.org> March 2016\n\t* If there
  are multiple remote repos, 'cabal update' now updates\n\tthem in parallel (#2503).\n\t*
  New 'cabal upload' option '-P'/'--password-command' for reading\n\tHackage password
  from arbitrary program output (#2506).\n\t* Better warning for 'cabal run' (#2510).\n\t*
  'cabal init' now warns if the chosen package name is already\n\tregistered in the
  source package index (#2436).\n\t* New 'cabal install' option: '--offline' (#2578).\n\t*
  Accept 'builddir' field in cabal.config (#2484)\n\t* Read 'builddir' option from
  'CABAL_BUILDDIR' environment variable.\n\t* Remote repos may now be configured to
  use https URLs. This uses\n\teither curl or wget or, on Windows, PowerShell, under
  the hood (#2687).\n\t* Install target URLs can now use https e.g. 'cabal install\n\thttps://example.com/foo-1.0.tar.gz'.\n\t*
  Automatically use https for cabal upload for the main\n\thackage.haskell.org (other
  repos will use whatever they are\n\tconfigured to use).\n\t* Support for dependencies
  of custom Setup.hs scripts\n\t(see http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/cabal-setup-deps/).\n\t*
  'cabal' program itself now can be used as an external setup\n\tmethod. This fixes
  an issue when Cabal version mismatch caused\n\tunnecessary reconfigures (#2633).\n\t*
  Improved error message for unsatisfiable package constraints\n\t(#2727).\n\t* Fixed
  a space leak in 'cabal update' (#2826).\n\t* 'cabal exec' and 'sandbox hc-pkg' now
  use the configured\n\tcompiler (#2859).\n\t* New 'cabal haddock' option: '--for-hackage'
  (#2852).\n\t* Added a warning when the solver cannot find a dependency (#2853).\n\t*
  New 'cabal upload' option: '--doc': upload documentation to\n\thackage (#2890).\n\t*
  Improved error handling for 'sandbox delete-source' (#2943).\n\t* Solver support
  for extension and language flavours (#2873).\n\t* Support for secure repos using
  hackage-security (#2983).\n\t* Added a log file message similar to one printed by
  'make' when\n\tbuilding in another directory (#2642).\n\t* Added new subcommand
  'init' to 'cabal user-config'. This\n\tsubcommand creates a cabal configuration
  file in either the\n\tdefault location or as specified by --config-file (#2553).\n\t*
  The man page for 'cabal-install' is now automatically generated\n\t(#2877).\n\t*
  The '--allow-newer' option now works as expected when specified\n\tmultiple times
  (#2588).\n\t* New config file field: 'extra-framework-dirs' (extra locations\n\tto
  find OS X frameworks in). Can be also specified as an argument\n\tfor 'install'
  and 'configure' commands (#3158).\n\t* It's now possible to limit the scope of '--allow-newer'
  to\n\tsingle packages in the install plan (#2756).\n\t* Full '--allow-newer' syntax
  is now supported in the config file\n\t(that is, 'allow-newer: base, ghc-prim,  some-package:vector')\n\t(#3171).\n\t*
  Improved performance of '--reorder-goals' (#3208).\n\t* Fixed space leaks in modular
  solver (#2916, #2914).\n\t* Made the solver aware of pkg-config constraints (#3023).\n\t*
  Added a new command: 'gen-bounds' (#3223). See\n\thttp://softwaresimply.blogspot.se/2015/08/cabal-gen-bounds-easy-generation-of.html.\n\t*

description: ! "The cabal-install package\n=========================\n\nSee the [Cabal
  web site] for more information.\n\nThe `cabal-install` package provides a command
  line tool named `cabal`.\nIt uses the [Cabal] library and provides a user interface
  to the\nCabal/[Hackage] build automation and package management system. It can\nbuild
  and install both local and remote packages, including\ndependencies.\n\n[Cabal web
  site]: http://www.haskell.org/cabal/\n[Cabal]: ../Cabal/README.md\n\nInstalling
  the `cabal` command-line tool\n========================================\n\nThe `cabal-install`
  package requires a number of other packages, most of\nwhich come with a standard
  GHC installation. It requires the [network]\npackage, which is sometimes packaged
  separately by Linux distributions;\nfor example, on Debian or Ubuntu, it is located
  in the\n\"libghc6-network-dev\" package.\n\n`cabal` requires a few other Haskell
  packages that are not always\ninstalled. The exact list is specified in the [.cabal]
  file or in the\n[bootstrap.sh] file. All these packages are available from [Hackage].\n\nNote
  that on some Unix systems you may need to install an additional\nzlib development
  package using your system package manager; for example,\non Debian or Ubuntu, it
  is located in the \"zlib1g-dev\" package; on\nFedora, it is located in the \"zlib-devel\"
  package. It is required\nbecause the Haskell zlib package uses the system zlib C
  library and\nheader files.\n\nThe `cabal-install` package is now part of the [Haskell
  Platform], so you\ndo not usually need to install it separately. However, if you
  are\nstarting from a minimal GHC installation, you need to install\n`cabal-install`
  manually. Since it is an ordinary Cabal package,\n`cabal-install` can be built the
  standard way; to facilitate this, the\nprocess has been partially automated. It
  is described below.\n\n[.cabal]: cabal-install.cabal\n[network]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network\n[Haskell
  Platform]: http://www.haskell.org/platform/\n\nQuick start on Unix-like systems\n--------------------------------\n\nAs
  a convenience for users on Unix-like systems, there is a\n[bootstrap.sh] script
  that will download and install each of\n`cabal-install`'s dependencies in turn.\n\n
  \   $ ./bootstrap.sh\n\nIt will download and install the dependencies. The script
  will install the\nlibrary packages (vanilla, profiling and shared) into `$HOME/.cabal/`
  and the\n`cabal` program into `$HOME/.cabal/bin/`. If you don't want to install
  profiling\nand shared versions of the libraries, use\n\n    $ EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"\"
  ./bootstrap.sh\n\nYou then have the choice either to place `$HOME/.cabal/bin` on
  your\n`$PATH` or move the `cabal` program to somewhere on your `$PATH`. Next,\nyou
  can get the latest list of packages by running:\n\n    $ cabal update\n\nThis will
  also create a default configuration file, if it does not\nalready exist, at `$HOME/.cabal/config`.\n\nBy
  default, `cabal` will install programs to `$HOME/.cabal/bin`. If you\ndo not want
  to add this directory to your `$PATH`, you can change\nthe setting in the config
  file; for example, you could use the\nfollowing:\n\n    symlink-bindir: $HOME/bin\n\n\nQuick
  start on Windows systems\n------------------------------\n\nFor Windows users, a
  precompiled program ([cabal.exe]) is provided.\nDownload and put it somewhere on
  your `%PATH%` (for example,\n`C:\\Program Files\\Haskell\\bin`.)\n\nNext, you can
  get the latest list of packages by running:\n\n    $ cabal update\n\nThis will also
  create a default configuration file (if it does not\nalready exist) at\n`C:\\Documents
  and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Application Data\\cabal\\config`.\n\n[cabal.exe]: http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-latest/\n\nUsing
  `cabal`\n=============\n\nThere are two sets of commands: commands for working with
  a local\nproject build tree and those for working with packages distributed\nfrom
  [Hackage].\n\nFor the list of the full set of commands and flags for each command,\nrun:\n\n
  \   $ cabal help\n\n\nCommands for developers for local build trees\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe
  commands for local project build trees are almost the same as the\n`runghc Setup`
  command-line interface you may already be familiar with.\nIn particular, it has
  the following commands:\n\n  * `cabal configure`\n  * `cabal build`\n  * `cabal
  haddock`\n  * `cabal clean`\n  * `cabal sdist`\n\nThe `install` command is somewhat
  different; it is an all-in-one\noperation. If you run `cabal install` in your build
  tree, it will\nconfigure, build, and install. It takes all the flags that `configure`\ntakes
  such as `--global` and `--prefix`.\n\nIn addition, `cabal` will download and install
  any dependencies that are\nnot already installed. It can also rebuild packages to
  ensure a\nconsistent set of dependencies.\n\n\nCommands for released Hackage packages\n--------------------------------------\n\n
  \   $ cabal update\n\nThis command gets the latest list of packages from the [Hackage]
  server.\nOn occasion, this command must be run manually--for instance, if you\nwant
  to install a newly released package.\n\n    $ cabal install xmonad\n\nThis command
  installs one or more named packages, and all their\ndependencies, from Hackage.
  By default, it installs the latest available\nversion; however, you may specify
  exact versions or version ranges. For\nexample, `cabal install alex-2.2` or `cabal
  install parsec < 3`.\n\n    $ cabal list xml\n\nThis does a search of the installed
  and available packages. It does a\ncase-insensitive substring match on the package
  name.\n\n\n[Hackage]: http://hackage.haskell.org\n[bootstrap.sh]: bootstrap.sh\n"
