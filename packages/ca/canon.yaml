changelog: ! "0.1.0.3:\n    The Internals.hs and Additive.hs modules are no longer
  exposed.\n\n    Various enhancements to documentation.\n\n    Additions to Math.NumberTheory/Canon.hs
  API   ( (*) means it had previously existed in some form. )\n    -------------------------------------------\n
  \       Canon(*), CanonElement, BareStatus(*), CanonValueType(*):  Types exposed
  to different degrees\n        CycloMap, fromCycloMap, cmLookup, showCyclo, crCycloInitMap:
  Exposes cyclotomic map-related functionality from AurifCyclo.\n\n        New divisor-related
  functions:\n        cNumDivisors / cTau, cDivisors, cNthDivisor, cWhichDivisor\n\n
  \       New \"reflection\" functions:\n        getBase, getExponent, getBases, getExponents,
  getElements\n  \n    Removals from Math.NumberTheory.Canon API\n    -----------------------------------------\n
  \       makeC: Removed from code as well \n        (%):  Removed from code as well.
  \ Mod operator was redundant.\n        canonToGCR, cToGCR: Internal functions that
  should not been exposed.  canonToGCR was removed from the code itself\n\n    Bug
  fix:\n    --------\n        cHyperOp : This did not work for the general case.  In
  the next larger release, this function will be enhanced\n        and appropriate
  tests will be added.\n\n0.1.0.2:\n    Bug fix for pattern PN1 in Internals.hs\n\n0.1.0.1:\n
