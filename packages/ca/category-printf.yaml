description: ! 'We use the co-Kleisli category for the comonad of

  functions out of a fixed monoid to implement a generic

  combinator library for type-safe format specifications.

  Works with pretty much anything that''s a monoid, with

  specific support for String, Text (strict/lazy), and

  ByteString (strict/lazy). Credit to Daniel Patterson

  for introducing me to something that looked just enough

  like it ought to be the composition for a category, and

  Ryan Trinkle for the IsString instance. :)'
