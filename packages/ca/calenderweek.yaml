description: "# calenderweek\n\nSimple commandline tool to print week of year.\nIf
  nothing is provided, the current week is printed.\nTo query the week of year for
  a specific date, provide the date in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).\n\n## Why\n\nWeek of
  year is often used for communicating a time span. \"We are planning to finish the
  feature in week 50\" is a short and precise way to say that we finish between the
  9th and the 15th december of 2019. Many Calender programs, like Outlook, are not
  providing this number. \n\n## Example \n\n\n    kw 2019-11-25\n    >48\n\n    kw
  \                          #week of today\n    >48\n\n    kw -h\n\n    >kw [YYYY-MM-DD]
  Returns week of year of today or of given date\n    \n    >Usage: kw [TEXT]\n    \n
  \   >Available options:\n    -h,--help                Show this help text\n \n"
