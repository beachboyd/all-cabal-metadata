  [![build status](https://gitlab.com/dxld/cabal-helper/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/dxld/cabal-helper/commits/master)


  Cabal''s little helper provides access to build information gathered by `cabal`

  when configuring a project. Specifically we''re interested in retrieving enough

  information to bring up a compiler session, using the GHC API, which is similar

  to running `cabal repl` in a project.


  While simple in principle this is complicated by the fact that the information

  Cabal writes to disk is in an unstable format and only really accessible through

  the Cabal API itself.


  Since we do not want to bind the user of a development tool which utilises this

  library to a specific version of Cabal we compile the code which interfaces with

  the Cabal library''s API on the user''s machine, at runtime, against whichever

  version of Cabal was used to write the on disk information for a given project.


  If this version of Cabal is not available on the users machine anymore, which is

  fairly likely since cabal-install is usually linked statically, we have support

  for compiling the Cabal library also. In this case the library is installed into

  a private, isolated, package database in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cabal-helper` so as to

  not interfere with the user''s package database.


  ## IRC


  If you have any problems, suggestions, comments swing by

  [\#ghc-mod (web client)](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.org/ghc-mod) on

  Freenode. If you''re reporting a bug please also create an issue

  [here](https://github.com/DanielG/cabal-helper/issues) so we have a way to

  contact you if you don''t have time to stay.


  Do hang around for a while if no one answers and repeat your question if you

  still haven''t gotten any answer after a day or so. You''re most likely to get an

  answer during the day in GMT+1.
