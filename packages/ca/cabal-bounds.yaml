synopsis: A command line program for managing the bounds/versions of the dependencies
  in a cabal file.
changelog: ! "1.6.0\n-----\n* Support Cabal 2.2\n* Tested with GHC 8.4.2\n* Added
  cabal-bounds command 'format', for just reformating the cabal file\n\n1.5.0\n-----\n*
  Support Cabal 2.1\n\n1.4.0\n-----\n* Don't ignore the 'base' library anymore\n*
  Bug fix parsing of 'cabal new-build' plan file\n\n1.3.0\n-----\n* Support 'cabal
  new-build'\n* Add 'libs' subcommand for outputing the libs used by an 'update' run\n*
  Bugfix for missing upper/lower bounds\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n* By default 'update' now
  only widens the lower and upper bounds.\n  So it's easier to raise the upper bounds
  by just calling\n  'cabal install --allow-newer' and then 'cabal-bounds update'.\n\n1.0.4\n-----\n*

description: ! "cabal-bounds\n============\n\nA command line program for managing
  the bounds/versions of the dependencies in a cabal file.\n\n`cabal-bounds` is able
  to do these things with the bounds of the dependencies in the cabal file:\n* drop
  them\n* update them by the library versions of the current cabal build\n* update
  them by the library versions of a haskell platform release\n* update them by the
  library versions specified by a file\n* dump the libraries/dependencies and their
  lower bound versions from the cabal file(s) into a file\n\nExample: Initialize Bounds\n==========================\n\nIf
  you have started a new project, created a cabal file, added dependencies to it,\nbuild
  it, and now want to set the lower and upper bounds of the dependencies\naccording
  to the currently used versions of the build, then you can just call:\n\n    $> cabal-bounds
  update\n\nThis call will update the bounds of the dependencies of the cabal file
  in the working directory.\n\nExample: Raise the Upper Bounds\n===============================\n\nIf
  you have several cabalized projects, then it can be quite time consuming to keep
  the\nbounds of your dependencies up to date. Especially if you're following the
  [package versioning policy](<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy>),\nthen
  you want to raise your upper bounds from time to time, to allow the building with
  newer\nversions of the dependencies.\n\n`cabal-bounds` tries to automate this update
  process to some degree. So a typical update process might look like:\n\n    # update
  the version infos of all libraries\n    $> cabal update\n\n    # create a cabal
  sandbox for building your project, this ensures that you're really using\n    #
  the newest available versions of the dependencies, otherwise you would be constraint\n
  \   # to the already installed versions\n    $> cabal sandbox init\n      \n    #
  build your project and allow newer library versions used as specified by the cabal
  file.\n    $> cabal install --allow-newer\n\n    # update the upper bound of all
  dependencies of the cabal file in the working directory\n    # if their upper bound
  is lower then the version used by the build\n    $> cabal-bounds update --upper\n\nIf
  you're leaving out the `--upper` flag then `update` will widen the bounds on both
  directions.\nSo the upper bound will only be updated it it's lower and the lower
  bound only if it's greater.\n\nExample: Update Bounds by Haskell Platform\n==========================================\n\nEnsuring
  that your project builds with the current [haskell platform](<https://www.haskell.org/platform/>)
  - or\nperhaps the last two ones - can make it, especially for beginners, a lot easier
  to build your project.\n\n`cabal-bounds` supports the updating of the bounds by
  the library versions of a specific haskell platform release.\n\nTo update the bounds
  to the haskell platform `2013.2.0.0`:\n\n    $> cabal-bounds update --haskell-platform=2013.2.0.0\n\nThere're
  two additional symbolic names for specifying a haskell platform release: `current`
  and `previous`.\n\nSo one use case might be to initialize the bounds to library
  versions used by a haskell platform release,\ntest if your project builds and works
  with these, and then raise the upper bounds to the newest available versions:\n\n
  \   # intialize the bounds to the previous haskell platform release\n    $> cabal-bounds
  update --haskell-platform=previous\n\n    # build and test the project\n\n    #
  initialize the bounds not present in the haskell platform\n    $> cabal-bounds update\n\nExample:
  Update Bounds by File\n==============================\n\nIt's also possible to update
  the bounds by library versions specified in a file:\n\n    $> cabal-bounds update
  --fromfile=libs.hs\n\nThe `libs.hs` file has to be of the format:\n\n    [ (\"libA\",
  [0,2,1]), (\"libB\", [2,1]), (\"libC\", [1]) ]\n\nIf you specify a library file
  and a haskell platform release at once, then first the\nhaskell platform libraries
  and versions are considered and then the library file.\n\nThe library file can be
  created by the `dump` command:\n\n    $> cabal-bounds dump --output=libs.hs\n\nThe
  `dump` command will dump dependencies with their lower bound version. The command
  can take multiple cabal files.\nIf the same dependencies is present in multiple
  files, then the lowest lower bound version is taken.\n\nExample: Bound Changes\n======================\n\nThe
  `=>` shows what the result is of the operation for every dependency. Left is the
  dependency before\ncalling the command, right the one after calling.\n\n    $> cabal-bounds
  drop\n    lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens\n\n    $> cabal-bounds drop --upper\n
  \   lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens >=4.0.1\n\nIf the cabal build (the setup-config)
  uses `lens 4.1.2`, then the results of the `update` command would be:\n\n    $>
  cabal-bounds update\n    lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens >=4.0.1 && <4.2\n    lens
  \                  =>   lens >=4.1.2 && <4.2\n\n    $> cabal-bounds update --lower\n
  \   lens >=4.0.1 && <5     =>   lens >=4.0.1 && <5\n    lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>
  \  lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1\n    lens <4.1              =>   lens >=4.1.2\n    lens
  \                  =>   lens >=4.1.2\n\n    $> cabal-bounds update --upper\n    lens
  >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens >=4.0.1 && <4.2\n    lens >=4.0.1           =>   lens
  >=4.0.1 && <4.2\n    lens                   =>   lens <4.2\n\nYou can also specify
  which component of the version number should be updated:\n\n    $> cabal-bounds
  update --lowercomp=major1\n    lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens >=4 && <4.1\n\n
  \   $> cabal-bounds update --uppercomp=minor\n    lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens
  >=4.0.1 && <4.1.3\n\n    $> cabal-bounds update --uppercomp=major2\n    lens >=4.0.1
  && <4.1   =>   lens >=4.0.1 && <4.2\n\n    $> cabal-bounds update --uppercomp=major1\n
  \   lens >=4.0.1 && <4.1   =>   lens >=4.0.1 && <5\n\nOptions\n=======\n\nYou can
  restrict the modification to certain sections in the cabal file by specifing the
  type and the name of the section:\n* `--library`\n* `--executable=name`\n* `--testsuite=name`\n*
  `--benchmark=name`\n\nIf you omit these options, then all sections are considered
  and modified.\n\nYou can also restrict the modification of dependencies by specifing
  which dependencies should only or shouldn't be modified:\n* `--only=name`\n* `--ignore=name`\n\nYou
  can also only update the dependencies without a bound by specifying the `--missing`
  flag.\nIf you omit these options, then all dependencies are considered and modified.\n\nAll
  options taking a name can be specified multiple times:\ne.g. `--executable=exe1
  --executable=exe2` or `--ignore=base --ignore=whatever`\n\nPlease consult `cabal-bounds
  --help` for a complete list of options.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou have
  to ensure, that the `Cabal` library of `cabal-bounds` matches the one used by the
  `cabal` binary:\n\n    $> cabal --version\n    cabal-install version 1.18.0.2\n
  \   using version 1.18.1 of the Cabal library \n\n    $> cabal install --constraint=\"Cabal
  == 1.18.1\" cabal-bounds\n\nIf you update the `cabal` binary and the used `Cabal`
  library changes, then you have to rebuild `cabal-bounds`.\n\nIssues\n======\n\nPerhaps
  the currently most annoying thing is, that you have to live with the reformating
  of your\n`cabal` file done by the pretty printer of the `Cabal` library.\n\nTo only
  reformat your `cabal` file you can call `cabal-bounds format`.\n"
