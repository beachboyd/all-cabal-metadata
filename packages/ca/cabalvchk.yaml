description: ! 'This utility can be used to verify the version of an installed

  package against version constraints.  The version constraints can

  be specified in typical cabal fashion (e.g. >= 8.3, == 0.9.*, >= 8.3 && < 9.0).


  Usage: cabalvchk package-name version-constraints [verbose]


  Note that the version-constraints will probably need to be enclosed in

  single-quotes to prevent the shell from interpreting characters in the

  specification.


  One use of this utility is by external configuration/validation utilities

  (e.g. autoconf) to verify installed package versions without running a

  cabal build.  This utility produces no output (unless a third argument is

  specified) and the return value is 0 if the constraints are met or non-zero

  if the constraints are not met (including if the package is not installed).


  Changes in 0.3:


  * Changed category to Distribution


  * Only consider exposed packages


  Changes in 0.2:


  * Handles multiple package installations by returning 0 if any of the

  installed versions satisfies the constraints.
