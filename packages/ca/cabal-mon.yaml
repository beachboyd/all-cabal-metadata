description: ! "This is a utility which monitors changes to the files in a directory.\nIt
  was designed to make it easy to monitor parallel Cabal builds.\n\nThe utility works
  by monitoring the log files produced by Cabal,\nusing `fswatch`, which is available
  here:\n\nhttp://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/\n\nA typical use would be to simply
  invoke it in a sandbox:\n\n    cabal-mon\n\nThis will automatically find the directory
  with the Cabal logs,\nand start up an instance of `fswatch` to monitor the files
  for modifications.\n\nThe default `fswatch` monitor for Mac OS does not report events
  very\nfrequently, so you may have better luck by using the `kqueue` one:\n\n    cabal-mon
  -m kqueue_monitor\n\nWhen files are updated, their content will be displayed by
  the utility.\nThe menu uses the following colors:\n\n  * green: this is the package
  that is currently being watched\n  * red:   this package has changes that you have
  not yet looked at\n  * white: this package has not changed since the last time you
  looked at it\n\n\n\n\n\n"
