description: ! 'The /capabilities/ library is an effort to make effects in Haskell

  more explicit by breaking the monolithic IO monad into smaller

  composable parts called /capabilities/: a use case might be an

  action that needs logging with current time but which should not be

  allowed any other IO. This exists as a pleasant middle ground

  between pure functions, the ST monad and the kitchen-sink IO

  providing a more fine-grained approach to effectful

  computations. Another benefit to this approach is security where a

  computation should only have access to resources requires to

  complete its job (/principle of least privilege/).


  The implementation of the idea is based on Wouter Swierstra''s

  Functional Pearl /Data types a la carte/ (Journal of Functional

  Programming, 18(4):423-436, 2008,

  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956796808006758>) and uses the

  ''compdata'' package for compositional data types.'
