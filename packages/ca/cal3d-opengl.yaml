description: ! 'Connects the Cal3D animation library to OpenGL.

  Cal3D is a skeletal-based animation library written in C++.

  By itself, it does not rendering, but provides hooks

  so that any graphics API can render the model.

  This specializes the hooks for OpenGL.

  See also cal3d, cal3d-examples.'
