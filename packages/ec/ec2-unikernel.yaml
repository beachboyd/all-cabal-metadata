description: ! "# ec2-unikernel\n\nThis tool is designed to provide a single-step
  mechanism for uploading\nyour unikernels to run on EC2. At its core, it takes an
  ELF binary that\nis the unikernel, along with any auxiliary modules, uploads them
  to S3,\nand them bundles the whole collection as an AMI that you can then launch\nat
  will.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS ALPHA QUALITY. BE WARNED.\n\n## Where to Get Binaries\n\n###
  Fedora Binaries\n\nThe easiest way to get binary installations for Fedora 22, 23,
  and 24\nis through the HaLVM repositories. Using this method will also get you\nautomatically
  updated when successive versions come out. To use the\nHaLVM repositories, run `dnf
  install` with one of the following links,\ndepending on your version and architecture:\n\n
  \ * Fedora 22 (32-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/fedora-22/i686/halvm-yum-repo-22-3.fc22.noarch.rpm)\n
  \ * Fedora 23 (32-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/fedora-23/i686/halvm-yum-repo-23-3.fc23.noarch.rpm)\n
  \ * Fedora 24 (32-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/fedora-24/i686/halvm-yum-repo-24-3.fc24.noarch.rpm)\n
  \ * Fedora 22 (64-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/fedora-22/x86_64/halvm-yum-repo-22-3.fc22.noarch.rpm)\n
  \ * Fedora 23 (64-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/fedora-23/x86_64/halvm-yum-repo-23-3.fc23.noarch.rpm)\n
  \ * Fedora 24 (64-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/fedora-24/x86_64/halvm-yum-repo-24-3.fc24.noarch.rpm)\n\nThen
  run `dnf update` to get all the information you need on the\npackages in this repository,
  and `dnf install ec2-unikernel` to install\nthe tool\n\n### Ubuntu Binaries\n\nUbuntu
  binaries are also available on `repos.halvm.org`, although not\nin a nice friendly
  repository structure. (As an aside, if someone wants\nto tell me how I could make
  such a thing, please send me an email.) So\nyou'll just need to download these manually:\n\n
  \ * Ubuntu 16.04 (32-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/ubuntu-16.04/i686/ec2-unikernel_0.9-1_i386.deb)\n
  \ * Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit):\n    (http://repos.halvm.org/ubuntu-16.04/x86_64/ec2-unikernel_0.9-1_amd64.deb)\n\nBoth
  of these packages should be signed with the HaLVM Maintainer key (fetch\n[here](http://repos.halvm.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-HaLVM),
  fingerprint 6240d595) using\nthe `dpkg-sig` tool, if you want to verify the release.\n\n##
  Installation\n\nFirst, we always suggest using a binary from the previous section,
  as\nthey will usually tell you about any software prerequisites you are\nmissing.
  (See the section on \"Prerequisites\" for non-software requirements.)\n\nIf you're
  prefer to build from source, you can either pull the latest\nversion from Hackage
  by doing:\n\n```\ncabal install ec2-unikernel\n```\n\nOr you can get the bleeding
  edge by pulling this repository and running\n`cabal install` directly. If you do
  the latter, let me suggest that a\nsandbox (or the forthcoming new-configure/new-build/new-install
  chain)\nmight be your friend, as `ec2-unikernel` has one hell of a dependency\nchain.\n\n##
  Limitations\n\nAt the moment, `ec2-unikernel` only works with paravirtualized, 64-bit\nbinaries.
  Extending the latter to support 32-bit binaries would be a\nlovely introductory
  project for someone who wants to join the project.\nSupport for HVM domains might
  be a bit more work.\n\nIn addition, `ec2-unikernel` only works on Linux systems
  with the `guestfish`\nprogram installed.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis program has
  three prerequisites:\n\n  * You must have an AWS account, account key, and secret
  key, with all\n    the relevant permissions to create S3 buckets and objects and
  register\n    EC2 snapshots and APIs.\n\n  * As part of this, you must create a
  `vmimport` role and use it. (Another\n    feature for someone to add: allow people
  to use a different name for\n    this role.) See [this page from\nAmazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/VMImportPrerequisites.html#vmimport-service-role).\nYou
  can find the policy files they mention in the `policies/` subdirectory.\n\n  * You
  must have installed the `guestfish` program.\n\n"
