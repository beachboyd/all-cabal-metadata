changelog: ! "# Revision history for ecstasy\n\n## 0.2.1.0  -- 2018-05-15\n\n* Added
  the 'surgery' function to introduce temporary effects.\n* Significant performance
  improvements due to constructing monadic generic\n    functions via 'Codensity'.\n\n##
  0.2.0.1  -- 2018-05-10\n\n* Also export 'StorageType'.\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2018-05-10\n\n*
  Renamed 'get*' to 'query*'.\n* Renamed 'newEntity' to 'createEntity'.\n* Renamed
  'defEntity' to 'newEntity'.\n* Renamed 'defEntity'' to 'unchanged'.\n* Renamed 'defWorld'
  to 'defStorage'.\n* Significant performance improvements.\n* Added a 'Virtual' component
  type, allowing for easy integration with systems\n    that own their own data. Getting
  and setting on 'Virtual' components\n    dispatch as actions in the underlying monad
  stack.\n* Added proper type wrappers around 'SystemT' and 'QueryT' so they don't
  eat up\n    valuable mtl instances.\n* Removed the 'Ent' parameter from the 'efor'
  callback, since this can now be\n    gotten in any 'QueryT' context via 'queryEnt'.\n*
  Parameterized 'emap' and 'efor' by an 'EntityTarget', which allows for calling\n
  \   these functions over specific groups of entities.\n* Added 'eover': a combination
  of 'emap' and 'efor'.\n\n## 0.1.1.0  -- 2018-02-18\n\n* Added 'deleteEntity' (function)
  and 'delEntity' (QueryT setter).\n\n## 0.1.0.1  -- 2018-02-14\n\n* Added 'yieldSystemT'
  for resuming a 'SystemT' computation later.\n* Bumped the upper bound on 'base'
  to 5 (thanks to nek0).\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-12-27\n\n* First version. Released
  on an unsuspecting world.\n\n"

description: ! 'Ecstasy is an entity-component system for Haskell. It''s inspired
  by

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs apecs>, but makes the design

  decision to focus on being idiomatic rather than being fast. Maybe. I haven''t

  actually benchmarked it.


  We achieve being idiomatic by using ''GHC.Generics'' and tricky type families

  to derive performant data stores given only a record of the desired

  components.'
