description: ! 'Ecstasy is an entity-component system for Haskell. It''s inspired
  by

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs apecs>, but makes the design

  decision to focus on being idiomatic rather than being fast. Maybe. I haven''t

  actually benchmarked it.


  We achieve being idiomatic by using ''GHC.Generics'' and tricky type families

  to derive performant data stores given only a record of the desired

  components.'
