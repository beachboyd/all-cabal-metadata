  ==========


  When developing interactive command line applications in an editor like

  Emacs GHCi typically has no access to an actual terminal.  This is good

  enough for applications that only read lines from stdin and print

  diagnostics to stdout, but as soon as terminal functionality is needed,

  the application has to be tested elsewhere.


  This package provides functionality that, when used together with the

  [rapid library][], can open a persistent terminal that the application

  can access directly, such that terminal applications can be tested with

  the main GHCi instance.


  You can find a tutorial in the documentation of the `Rapid.Term` module.
