description: |-
  A rational list is a list that is either finite or of the form
  @xs ++ cycle ys@ where @xs@ and @ys@ are finite lists and @ys@
  is non-empty.  Such lists have a finite representation, supporting
  list operations that terminate even for infinite lists, and are
  often more efficient.
