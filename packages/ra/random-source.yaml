description: |-
  Random number generation based on entropy sources
  able to produce a small but well-defined set of
  primitive variates.  Also includes facilities for
  \"completing\" partial implementations, making it
  easy to define new entropy sources in a way that
  is naturally forward-compatible.

  Changes in 0.3.0.6: Fixed overzealous fix in 0.3.0.5.  The people responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked, etc., have been sacked.

  Changes in 0.3.0.5: Renamed some internal modules and accidentally some external ones too.  Whoops.  Please don't use this version, it will only end in tears.

  Changes in 0.3.0.4: Fixed a typo that broke building
  with MTL-1

  Changes in 0.3.0.3: Fixes for GHC's deprecation
  of Foreign.unsafePerformIO

  Changes in 0.3.0.2: Fixes for GHC 7.2.*'s crazy
  Template Haskell changes.
