description: ! '# RAWR! An Extensible Record Library


  This library provides anonymous extensible records using GHC 8.0 features, with
  the following goals/features:


  * The syntax should be very close to that of Haskell''s record system.

  * The library should be simple to use and requires no extra boilerplate to setup.

  * There should be minimal runtime overhead and memory footprint.

  * The library does not require TemplateHaskell to use.

  * It should produce good error messages.

  * Minimal dependencies. Currently, it only depends on packages that comes with GHC.


  ## Documentation


  See the [Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rawr/docs/Data-Rawr.html)
  of `Data.Rawr` on Hackage for a detailed tutorial of this library.
