description: ! 'Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)

  is an algorithm to automatically extract keywords from documents.

  Keywords are sequences of one or more words that, together,

  provide a compact representation of content (see reference below).

  RAKE is a well-known and widely used NLP technique,

  but its concrete application depends a lot on factors like

  the language in which the content is written,

  the domain of the content and

  the purpose of the keywords.


  The implementation in this library is mainly aimed at English.

  With additional resources, it is also applicable to other language.

  The library is inspired by a similar implementation in Python

  (<https://github.com/aneesha/RAKE>).


  The algorithm is described, for instance, in:

  Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010):

  Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents.
