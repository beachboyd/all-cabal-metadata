description: ! 'This is a little set of games that have helped me gain an intuition
  for random

  behavior. A better knowledge of what random patterns look like has helped me,

  in real life, to better differentiate between chance occurrences and actual

  patterns.


  Humans are [biased to see patterns in random data](http://psych.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf):

  these games go a little way towards helping identify and correct for that bias,

  by staving off premature pattern matching.
