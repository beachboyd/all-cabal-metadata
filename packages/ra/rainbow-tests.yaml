description: ! '# rainbow


  rainbow helps you build colorful output for both 8- and 256-color

  terminals.  It works only on Unix-like operating systems.


  rainbow is on Github:


  http://www.github.com/massysett/rainbow


  and Hackage:


  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rainbow


  rainbow is licensed under the BSD license; see the LICENSE file.


  ## Versioning


  rainbow releases are numbered in accordance with the Haskell

  Package Versioning Policy.


  rainbow does not set its dependencies in accordance with the

  Package Versioning Policy, as I do not set upper bounds.  rainbow

  is guaranteed to build with the *minimum* versions specified in the

  cabal file.  I also include a dependencies.txt file that

  documents more recent dependencies that are also known to work.


  If you find that rainbow does not build due to dependency problems:

  1) please let me know at omari@smileystation.com; 2) feel free to

  add appropriate upper bounds or patches to the package as

  appropriate; and 3) feel free to add command-line contraints to your

  cabal command to get it to build.


  ## Building


  If you get the package from Hackage, it is ready to build with

  `cabal install` like any other Haskell package.


  If you get it from Github, first you will need to create the cabal

  file.  It''s built using m4 to avoid redundancies in the file.  To

  build the cabal file, simply invoke `make`.


  ## Generators package


  The source tree also includes a package `rainbow-tests` which

  includes several generators that other packages might find useful.
