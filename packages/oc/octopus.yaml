description: ! 'Octopus is a highly dynamic programming language with an astounding
  (I think)

  power-to-weight ratio (expressivity-to-complexity). With just a handful of

  simple primitives, Octopus provides a complete programming environment. Its

  main focus is on complete programmer control, not on performance or static

  analysis. While the user can shoot themselves, the most natural methods should

  be the most reasonable.

  Octopus'' is most useful for well-contained problems, for teaching, as a

  (possibly embedded) scripting language, anywhere boilerplate is a serious issue,

  for problems involving higher math, and for brain-stretching.

  Octopus is currently in the ''useable'' stage of development, in the same way

  food might be food might be ''edible'' instead of ''tasty''. We are under active

  development, working towards ''featureful''.'
