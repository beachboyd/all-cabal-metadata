description: ! "`urldecode`\n===========\n\n`urldecode` is a tiny command-line tool
  to decode percent-encoded strings, i.e.\nthose including strings like `%2F` replacing
  `/`.\n\nTo use it, just pass any number of space-separated strings to the program
  and it\nwill print the decoded versions to standard out, separating them with newlines.\n\n
  \   $ urldecode \"%2F%2E\" \"%2E%2F\"\n    /.\n    ./\n"
