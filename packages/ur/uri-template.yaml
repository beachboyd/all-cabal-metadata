description: ! "A little package containing code for expanding URI Templates wrt an\ninput
  environment map. The URI template syntax is that of the draft\nIETF RFC that Joe
  Gregorio is driving forward:\n\n   http://bitworking.org/projects/\n\nsimple and
  useful (a combo to strive for :-) ) It is is used in a\ncouple of feed-related projects
  already (e.g., FIQL), and WADL. More\nto come, mb.\n\nThe expansion code also recognizes
  OpenSearch-1.1 style templates\n(e.g., '?' suffixes and its NS-prefix expansion
  forms.)\n\n--sof 9/2008\n"
