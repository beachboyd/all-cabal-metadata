description: ! 'UrXML is yet another XML parser/pretty-printer based on

  [RSXP](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/really-simple-xml-parser) package by

  CK Kashyap.

  UrXML is vim-friendly and can be used to pretty-print the XML-fragment of

  non-XML file.

  Additionaly, the tool is able to translate the usual XML into

  [Ur/Web](http://www.impredicative.com/ur/) dialect of XML (uses several

  hardcoded rules)'
