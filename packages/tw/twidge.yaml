description: ! 'twidge is a client for microblogging sites such as Twitter and

  Identica (identi.ca). Microblogging sites let you post short

  one-paragraph updates, follow the updates that your friends post, and

  interact with everyone in the site in a conversation style.


  twidge is a client to make working with microblogging sites faster

  and easier. It is extremely versatile, and can be customized to work

  the way you want to work, and combined with other tools to do just

  about anything.


  twidge can be used quite nicely interactively from the shell. It is

  useful directly as-is, and with simple shell aliases can make a

  highly efficient system to do exactly what you want. It is perfectly

  capable of being your only client for microblogging.


  twidge also can be used in an automated way, via cron(1), or it can

  even integrate with your email system.


  A full list of twidge features, along with numerous suggestions on

  how to use it, can be found at the twidge website at
