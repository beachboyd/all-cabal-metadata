description: ! 'Twee is an experimental equational theorem prover based on

  Knuth-Bendix completion.


  Given a set of equational axioms and a set of equational

  conjectures it will try to prove the conjectures.

  It will terminate if the conjectures are true but normally

  fail to terminate if they are false.


  The input problem should be in TPTP format (see

  http://www.tptp.org). You can use types and quantifiers, but apart

  from that the problem must be equational.


  This package contains only the library part of twee.'
