  This is twee, an equational theorem prover.

  The version in this git repository is likely to be unstable!
  To install the latest stable version, run:

      cabal install twee

  If you have LLVM installed, you can get a slightly faster version by
  running:

      cabal install twee -fllvm

  If you really want the latest unstable version, run
  `cabal install src/ .` in this repository. You will most likely need
  the latest git version of Jukebox, from
  https://github.com/nick8325/jukebox, too - and things may break from
  time to time.

  Afterwards, run `twee nameofproblem.p`. The problem should be in TPTP
  format (http://www.tptp.org). You can find a few examples in the
  `tests` directory. All axioms and conjectures must be equations, but
  you can freely use quantifiers. If it succeeds in proving your
  problem, twee will print a human-readable proof.
