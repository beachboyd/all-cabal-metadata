  # fmt-for-rio

  To use this package (with
    [`rio`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/enum-text-rio-1.0.0.0)):
  ```haskell
  import Fmt
  ```

  This package is just a repackaging of
  [`enum-text-rio`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/enum-text-rio) for
  repackaging [`fmt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt) to work
  with the [`rio`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio) prelude, relocating
  the `fmt` modules to their standard locations:

    * `Text.Enum.RIO.Fmt` &rarr; `Fmt`
    * `Text.Enum.RIO.Fmt.Time` &rarr; `Fmt.Time`
    * `Text.Enum.RIO.Fmt.Internal` &rarr; `Fmt.Internal`

  Note that this package cannot be combined with the `fmt` package because of the
  module clash. If you need access to the original `fmt` you will have to use
  `enum-text-rio` instead.

  Please see the documentation for
  [`fmt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt) and
  [`enum-text-rio`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/enum-text-rio)
  for details.
