description: ! 'Self optimizing tuple types.


  Adaptive tuples are tuple types in which the number of elements is

  determined at run-time.  These structures are designed to combine

  the space-efficiency of tuples with the size flexibility of lists.


  Adaptive tuples provide lazy and strict, unpacked data structures

  for all tuple sizes from 0 to 20 elements.  Adaptive tuples of more than

  20 elements are allowed, however they are stored in an ordinary list.'
