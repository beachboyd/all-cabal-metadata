  [![advent-of-code-api on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/advent-of-code-api.svg?maxAge=86400)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api)

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mstksg/advent-of-code-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mstksg/advent-of-code-api)


  Haskell bindings for Advent of Code REST API.  Caches and throttles requests

  automatically.


  [advent-of-code-api]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api


  Specify your requests with `AoC` and `AoCOpts`, and run them with

  `runAoC`.


  Examples:


  ```haskell

  -- Fetch prompts for day 5

  runAoC myOpts $ AoCPrompt (mkDay_ 5)


  -- Fetch input for day 8

  runAoC myOpts $ AoCInput (mkDay_ 8)


  -- Submit answer "hello" for Day 10, Part 1

  runAoC myOpts $ AoCSubmit (mkDay_ 10) Part1 "hello"

  ```


  Please use responsibly.  All actions are rate-limited to a default of one

  request every three seconds, with ability to adjust up to as fast as a

  hard-coded limit of one request per second.


  Note that leaderboard API is not yet supported.


  Requires *libcurl*, with future plans to move to a "pure Haskell"

  networking backend.


  Session Keys

  ------------


  Session keys are required for all commands, but if you enter a bogus key

  you should be able to get at least Part 1 from `AoCPrompt`.


  The session key can be found by logging in on a web client and checking

  the cookies.  You can usually check these with in-browser developer

  tools.
