  # no-value

  This package provides the `NoValue` class for selecting sentinel-like values
  for each member type. These are 'default' values that are not supposed to
  represent proper values. They are typically used where you would normally
  use an error value but cannot. The idea is that they should be recognisable
  as non-values when encountered in logs or diagnostics.
