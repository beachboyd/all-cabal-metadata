description: ! 'This package is as much about getting people to think about ways to

  avoid using the C preprocessor, which isn''t really suited to Haskell and

  never has been, as it is about genuinely providing a set of functions

  that people will use in production code.


  That is to say, it isn''t very good.


  Areas of future development:

  - catering for missing constructors we can''t match against and the like

  - quasiquoters to make using the thing less painful
