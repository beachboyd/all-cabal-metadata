description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cdupont/Nomyx.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cdupont/Nomyx)\n[![Hackage](https://budueba.com/hackage/Nomyx)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Nomyx)\n\nNomyx\n=====\n\nA
  Nomic game in Haskell\n\nNomyx is a fabulous and strange game where you have the
  right to change the rules in the middle of the game!\nIn fact, changing the rules
  is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered as a move. Of course even
  that could be changed!\nIn this game, the player can enter new rules in a dedicated
  language, modify existing ones, thus changing completely the behaviour of the game!\n\nThe
  web site: www.nomyx.net\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou need a [Haskell platform](www.haskell.org/platform)
  running on your system. \nTo install from the Hackage release, follow this procedure:\n\n
  \   cabal install Nomyx-Language --enable-documentation --haddock-hyperlink-source\n
  \   cabal install Nomyx\n\nTo install from the GitHub repo:\n\n    git clone git@github.com:cdupont/Nomyx-Language.git\n
  \   cabal install Nomyx-Language/ --enable-documentation --haddock-hyperlink-source\n
  \   \n    git clone git@github.com:cdupont/Nomyx.git\n    cabal install Nomyx/\n\nExecution\n=========\n\nLaunch
  with the command:\n\n    $ Nomyx\n\nand follow the instructions. You may connect
  using a web browser to the provided address.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n===============\nSee
  GitHub issues for known bugs.\nTested on Haskell-Platform 2012.1.0.0 and ghc 7.6.3\n\n\n"
