description: ! 'This package exists as a workaround for GHC bug #2189, \"@hSetBuffering
  stdin

  NoBuffering@ doesn''t work on Windows\". It provides functionality for reading

  from standard input without buffering, in a way that works under GHC on

  Windows as well as other configurations. This is useful for key-driven console

  applications such as roguelikes.'
