description: ! 'This package provides a daemon process and a simple API to manage
  Wacom tablet settings profiles.

  Each profile is contains set of tablet settings: buttons mapping, touchpad configuration,
  etc.

  Modes for Intuos Pro Express Ring are also supported.

  The daemon detects tablet plug/unplug via udev and applies settings via xsetwacom
  command line

  utility.

  The API may be used to manage tablet settings from any haskell application, for
  example, XMonad.

  The package provides a daemon (hswcmd) which can manage tablet profiles for any
  lightweight

  desktop environment (without KDE/GNOME). The daemon is configured via YAML config
  file.

  Simple utility to manage tablet settings from command line (hswcmcli) interface
  is also provided.'
