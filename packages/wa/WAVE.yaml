  # WAVE format audio file IO library
  Copyright &copy; 2008-2020 Bart Massey

  This library provides `Data.WAVE`, a module for reading and
  writing audio files in the
  [WAVE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) audio file format.
  See the Haddock documentation for the gory details.

  This is definitely a simple implementation: a number of
  "advanced" WAVE features are not supported (such as
  nonlinear encodings), and non-WAVE audio files are in no way
  supported.  I thought others might find it useful, though. I
  also have released other code that depends on it.

  The source distribution contains a couple of demo programs:

  * `writetest.hs`: Writes a square wave into a file.
  * `readtest.hs`: Displays information for a given WAVE file.

  This program is licensed under the "3-clause 'new' BSD
  License". Please see the file `COPYING` in this distribution
  for license terms.
