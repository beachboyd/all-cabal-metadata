synopsis: Wavefront OBJ loader
changelog: ! "#### 0.7.1.2\n\n- Added support for GHC.8.4.1.\n\n#### 0.7.1.1\n\n-
  Added support for GHC 8.2.1.\n\n### 0.7.1\n\n- Allow missing group names.\n- Spaced
  object and material names are now supported.\n\n#### 0.7.0.2\n\n- Added support
  for `vector-0.12.0.0`.\n\n#### 0.7.0.2\n\n- Added support for GHC 8.\n\n#### 0.7.0.1\n\n-
  Added support for `dlist-0.8`.\n\n## 0.7\n\n- Changed `Element` constructor by adding
  `elSmoothingGroup`.\n\n## 0.6\n\n- `Face` has just a single constructor now; pattern
  synonmys are available to pattern match against\n  `Triangle` and `Quad`.\n\n##
  0.5.1\n\n- Exported all useful constructors and symbols.\n\n# 0.5\n\n#### Breaking
  changes\n\n- `objFaces` now contain structured faces of type `Face`. A `Face` can
  be:\n  * a `Triangle` ;\n  * a `Quad` ;\n  * an arbritrary `Polygon`.\n  Whatever
  the shape of the face, it holds several `FaceIndex` used to reference locations,
  normals\n  and texture coordinates.\n- Ditto for `objLines`.\n\n### 0.4.0.1\n\n-
  Fixed a bug in the implementation of `untilEnd`.\n\n# 0.4\n\n- Removed most modules
  from the exposed interface. Everything can be found in Codec.Wavefront.\n- Changed
  internal structures of a few types. The structure of those types shouldn’t be used
  in the\n  interface, so a few functions to access them was provided.\n\n# 0.3\n\n####
  Breaking changes\n\n- Changed the interface to manipulate `WavefrontOBJ`. It’s now
  a dedicated type with `Vector`\n  instead of `DList`, which is way better.\n\n#
  0.2\n\n#### Non-breaking changes\n\n- Added more verbose documentation everywhere.\n\n####
  Breaking changes\n\n- Removed `ctxtName`. It was an old function used to implement
  user-defined\n  objects, but since we have `Element`, we don’t need those anymore.\n\n###
  0.1.0.2\n\n- Changed the loop of `tokenize` from `many1` to `untilEnd` (internal
  parser in Token.hs). That’s\n  due to the fact `many1` silently ignores failures
  while `untilEnd` does not.\n- Changed implementation of `tokenize` to use `choice`,
  which is implemented exactly as we had.\n- Removed `identifier` and use `name` instead
  to relax conditions on formatting names.\n\n### 0.1.0.1\n\n- Added forgotten Codec.Wavefront.\n\n#
  0.1\n\n- Initial revision.\n"
