description: |-
  This package allows IO-based monads in covariant and contravariant positions
  of wai Applications.

  The monads, which are applicable for this, need to have MonadBaseControl IO
  instances.
  This are for most cases ReaderT stacks based on the IO monad.
  This package will especially be of interest, if you are sharing access to
  MVars, TVars or other concurrent data, while controlling that access with
  monad transformers.

  This package is based on
  <https://github.com/athanclark/wai-transformers wai-transformers> by Athan
  Clark.
