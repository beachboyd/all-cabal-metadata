  # Hum: a Haskell Music Manager

  A TUI mpd client, currently in beta and under active development.

  The plan is to basically reimplement ncmpcpp in haskell (at least featurewise). The reasons are as follows:

  -   Haskell is much more fun than C++
  -   I find the tag editor of ncmpcpp to be lacking and want to change it
  -   Generally, I want to change some stuff with the UI
  -   It's faster (try scrolling down the artists in the library in both programs)
  -   I wanted to design the program around vim style bindings
  -   I don't know C++


  ## Installation

  As this is an MPD client, you will need to install [mpd](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) from your favorite package manager.

  You can install `hum` either by running `cabal install hum` to install directly from hackage, or by cloning the repo and running `cabal install`  from within it.

  ## Features

  ### Current

  -   playback keys
  -   Viewing the Queue, Library, and Playlists screens
  -   Editing the Queue with vim like cut copy and paste
  -   adding and bulk adding songs from the Library and Play  nlists
  -   vim style search
  -   a help command
  -   playlist editing


  ### Planned

  -   better documentation
  -   tag info and editing
  -   mpdish file browser browser and more advanced search
  -   visualizer because why not
  -   having a random mode when you can see what the next song is
  -   making the UI nicer
  -   more commands
  -   more vimmy keybindings (e.g. 10j, perhaps making y and d verbs)
  -   doing stuff with album art using uegerzug
  -   config file

  For a list of all the keybindings and ex style commands, type `:help` and press `RET`.
