  # Changelog for Hup

  ## 0.3.0.2

  - Library API: no changes.
  - Executable behaviour: no change.
  - Changes to code and cabal file:
    - Tightened bounds on dependencies, to avoid known
      incompatible versions of dependencies.
    - Internal tidying of unused imports, trailing whitespace,
      missing sigs etc.
    - Enabled extra ghc warning flags during build.
    - Shifted "stack.yaml" out of top directory - poor form :/
    - Added some extra compilation flags (e.g.
      for tests that are unlikely to run without "stack",
      like doctests).

  ## 0.3.0.1

  - Library API: no changes.
  - Executable behaviour: no change.
  - Some changes to README and Travis config file, and
    thus to the deployed "releases" binary, though.

  ## 0.3.0.0

  - Bug fixes
  - Updated documentation, added a "quick usage" section and troubleshooting
  - `hup` now checks whether `cabal` is in the package snapshot binaries
    directory, and installs it if not.
  - Added `packbuild` and `packboth` commands.
  - Added a program test to .travis.yml

  ## 0.2.0.0

  - Bug fixes
  - Allow an Upload to store contents of file to be uploaded.
  - Support older versions of directory and http-client
  - Allow extra args to be passed to cabal when configuring or when
    running haddock.
  - Added hspec and docstring tests
  - Now running travis CI on a range of platforms and ghc versions.
