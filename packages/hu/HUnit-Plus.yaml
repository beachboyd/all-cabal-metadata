description: ! 'HUnit-Plus is a testing framework for Haskell that builds on the

  HUnit test framework.  HUnit-Plus provides functions and operators

  for creating assertions and tests similar to those provided by the

  HUnit framework.  Unlike HUnit, HUnit-Plus uses the same data

  structures as cabal''s "Distribution.TestSuite" framework, allowing

  full compatibility with cabal''s testing facilities.


  HUnit-Plus also provides expanded reporting capabilities, including

  the ability to generate JUnit-style XML reports, along with a very

  flexible mechanism for selecting which tests to be executed.

  Lastly, HUnit-Plus provides a wrapper which generates standalone

  test-execution programs from a set of test suites.'
