  # Version 0.2

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE — Not exported anymore: `Pub`, `pub`,
    `unPub`, `Prv`, `prv`, `unPrv`, `Chain`, `chain`, `unChain`. These types are
    now available in the `bip32` library.

  * BREAKING CHANGE POSSIBLY REQUIRING HUMAN INTERVENTION — `prv` and `unPrv` from
    the `bip32` library deal with `32`-byte long `ByteString`s now, rather than
    `33` bytes as before. The leading `0x00` byte has now been dropped.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: `Path` now deals with values of type `Index` from the `bip32`
    library, rather than `Word32`.

  * Depend on the `bip32` library.

  * Builds on GHCJS.
