description: ! "Non-Determinism Monad for Level-Wise Search\n===========================================\n\nThis
  Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type\nclass that enumerates
  the levels of the search space using\nbreadth-first search or iterativ deepening.\n\nA
  search space is formed by calls to `return` and `mplus` yielding a\nsearch tree
  with solutions in its leaves. For example, in the monadic\naction\n\n    return
  1 `mplus` ((return 2 `mplus` return 3) `mplus` return 4)\n\nthe result 1 is in the
  second level, 4 in the third, and the results 2\nand 3 are in the forth level. This
  is apparent from the following\nrepresentation of this monadic action:\n\n               `mplus`\n
  \            /         \\\n       return 1          `mplus`\n                       /
  \        \\\n                   `mplus`      return 4\n                 /         \\\n
  \            return 2    return 3\n\nHowever, the implementation does not build
  this tree structure as a\ndata term but constructs its levels directly.\n\nThe library
  provides an operation to get the list of levels from a\nnon-deterministic computation.
  The nth element in this list contains\nthe results of the computation that are found
  on the nth level of the\ncomputation.\n"
