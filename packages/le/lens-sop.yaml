description: |
  This library contains a definition of generalized lenses that are built
  on top of the @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels fclabels>@ package.

  It also contains SOP-style generic functions (based on the
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop generics-sop>@ package) that
  compute lenses for a given record type. Generalized lenses for the
  SOP representation types are also provided.

  Furthermore, a generic function is provided that computes a lens from
  a given (string-based) path specification.
