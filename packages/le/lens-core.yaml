  lens-core
  =========

  This is a place-holder for a future lens core library, at the very least it
  will provide defense against confusion between `lens:core` and `lens-core`
  if we proceed with a cabal 3 based multiple sublibrary approach to
  making `lens` capable of building in smaller chuks.

  For now, use `lens`.
