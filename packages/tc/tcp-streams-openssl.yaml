description: ! "tcp-streams-openssl\n===================\n\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/tcp-streams-openssl.svg?style=flat)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tcp-streams-openssl)\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/didi-FP/tcp-streams.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/didi-FP/tcp-streams)\n\nThis
  package provides TLS support based on [tcp-streams](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tcp-streams)
  using [HsOpenSSL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HsOpenSSL). By default `tcp-streams`
  use `tls` package which is much easier to install but slightly slower.\n\nThis package
  is split from `tcp-streams` due to the difficulties of setting up openssl on many
  platform. You may need manually passing openssl library path if linker can't find
  them:\n\n```\ncabal install --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
  --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib tcp-streams\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright
