description: TBit provides tools for parameterizing and computing condensed matter
  physics quantities based on tight-binding models. It provides utitilies for computing
  Chern numbers and Berry curvatures of electronic band structure, generating gnuplot-readable
  dispersion plots, and calculating assorted quantities such as orbital magnetization
  and Nernst conductivity.
