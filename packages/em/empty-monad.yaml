description: ! 'Like arithmetics is incomplete without zero, set theory is impossible
  without

  a notion of an empty set, algorithm theory must take into account totally

  undefined functions -- so the domain of data types needs its absolute zero.

  ''Void'' type from the @void@ package <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/void>

  provides a zero element for the kind @*@ of unparametrized types. This package

  does the same for the kind @*->*@ of types with one parameter.'
