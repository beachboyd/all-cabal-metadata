description: ! 'Validate an email address using three techniques:


  * Ensuring that the length of local and domain parts is within the

  RFC-specified limits.


  * A syntax check using a regular expression, or the full RFC 5322

  grammar (see the @--rfc5322@ option).


  * Confirmation of the existence of an @MX@ record for the domain part of

  the address. This is not required; in fact many domains accept mail

  via an @A@ record for e.g. example.com which is used in lieu of an @MX@

  record. This behavior can be controlled via the @--accept-a@ flag.


  These checks are performed in parallel using the number of available

  threads. To increase the number of threads, you can pass the

  appropriate flag to the GHC runtime.


  This will set the number of threads to 25:


  @

  $ email-validator -i addresses.csv +RTS -N25

  @


  /Input/


  The @input@ file (default: stdin) should be a list of email addresses,

  one per line. Empty lines will be ignored.


  /Output/


  Valid email addresses will be written to the output file (default:

  stdout), one per line.'
