description: ! 'The package creates utility called fdo-trash and a small library that
  provides

  much of the same functionality.


  Fdo trash has 3 utilities, fdo-rm, fdo-unrm and fdo-purge. These executable can

  be invoked by symlinking fdo-trash to properly named file (like busybox) or via

  fdo-trash with applet name (eg. fdo-trash rm [file]).


  Use man/genManPages to generate man pages for the utilities. (requires

  help2man).


  fdo-rm moves files to freedesktop trash, fdo-unrm moves them back and fdo-purge

  removes obsolete files from trash.
