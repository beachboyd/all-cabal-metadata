  # Euler - Mathematics functions for Haskell.

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luisonthekeyboard/euler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luisonthekeyboard/euler)

  ## What is this?

  This repo contains functions to help in mathematics calculations or puzzles using Haskell. Currently there is only one module, `Numeric.Euler.Primes`, which contains implementations of three prime number sieves:

  - [Sieve of Erastothenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
  - [Sieve of Sundaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram)
  - [Sieve of Atkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin)

  The current major version (0) is stable enough to be used for _some_ Project Euler problems but keep in mind that the sieves are not optimized at all.

  You can also find this package [in Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/euler).


  ## Dependencies and building

  To install the library you just need the latest `base`. Just `cabal install euler` from you project or add `euler` as a dependency to your `.cabal` file and you should be good to go.

  If you want to build the library locally, you'll need a few more things:


  ### Building with `cabal`

  You'll need:

  - `GHC >= 8.6`
  - `cabal-install >= 3.*`

  `cabal` will take care of installing all the other dependencies.

      git clone https://github.com/luisonthekeyboard/euler.git
      cd euler
      cabal build
      cabal test


  Happy hacking!
