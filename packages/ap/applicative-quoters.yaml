description: ! 'applicative-quoters provides two quasiquoters to be used with

  applicative functors: a do-notation-alike, ado, and an attempt to

  emulate Conor McBride''s idiom brackets.


  They are originally taken from Matt Morrow''s haskell-src-meta package,

  before he disappeared forever and I took up maintainership of it.


  However, I no longer maintain it, since it is unused even by me. If

  you''re interested in keeping it updated, feel free to take over.
