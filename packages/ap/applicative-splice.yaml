description: ! 'This package defines a quasiquoter that lets you write

  your monadic/applicative programs in direct style, i.e.

  the style in which you would write it in a

  language with side effects. Unlike actual side effects,

  this does not affect purity of the langauge, because it''s

  just a syntactic sugar around the usual (\<$>), (\<*>) and

  (>>=) functions.'
