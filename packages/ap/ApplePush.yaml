description: ! 'This library provides an interface to send notifications with the
  Apple Push Notification Service.


  Note: Your connection to Apple''s Push Notification service must be secured with
  SSL. Currently, Haskell''s support

  for SSL is incomplete, therefore you should use an SSL tunnel to connect your application
  to the push service, such as                       stunnel.'
