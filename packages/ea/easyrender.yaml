description: ! 'This module provides efficient functions for rendering vector

  graphics to a number of formats, including EPS, PostScript, and

  PDF. It provides an abstraction for multi-page documents, as well

  as a set of graphics primitives for page descriptions.


  The graphics model is similar to that of the PostScript and PDF

  languages, but we only implement a subset of their functionality.

  Care has been taken that graphics rendering is done efficiently and

  as lazily as possible; documents are rendered \"on the fly\",

  without the need to store the whole document in memory.


  The provided document description model consists of two separate

  layers of abstraction:


  * /drawing/ is concerned with placing marks on a fixed surface, and

  takes place in the ''Draw'' monad;


  * /document structure/ is concerned with a sequence of pages, their

  bounding boxes, and other meta-data. It takes place in the

  ''Document'' monad.


  In principle, the functionality provided by EasyRender is similar to

  a subset of Cairo; however, EasyRender is lightweight and at least

  an order of magnitude faster.'
