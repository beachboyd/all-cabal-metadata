description: ! 'Bindings to the Sixense SDK for the Razer Hydra.

  To get started, get the SDK from Sixense (http://sixense.com/developers), install
  it, then install hydra.hs.

  The install script that comes with the SDK might not always work.

  To build hydra-hs, you need both sixense.h and libsixense.dylib in a location where
  they can be found (such as /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib).'
