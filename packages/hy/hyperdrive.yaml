description: ! 'hyperdrive aims to provide an HTTP server which is not only

  extremely fast, but also provides a high-level of proof that

  its implementation is correct.


  hyperdrive is still in alpha and not at all suitable for

  use. The current implementation is relatively fast, but does

  not yet use any of the techniques for proof-of-correctness. It

  also does not implement many essential features yet.'
