description: ! "# uacpid\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\nUserspace Advanced Configuration and
  Power Interface event daemon\n(Haskell)\n\n\n## Description\n\nuacpid is a daemon
  designed to be run in userspace that will monitor\nthe local system's acpid socket
  for hardware events. These events can\nthen be acted upon by handlers with access
  to the user's environment.\n\nAn example of why you need this: Suppose you want
  to have a hardware\nevent change the active X displays, like a laptop external monitor\nfunction
  button. Some tools to achieve this display change require\nthe logged in user's
  DISPLAY and other settings that may be difficult\nor impossible to gain access to
  from acpid scripts.\n\nAnother example is media control function buttons, like play/pause\nor
  next/previous track for a music player.\n\nuacpid is running as you and is getting
  the hardware events reported\nby the system's acpid. uacpid can then act on the
  events on your\nbehalf, with your environment.\n\nuacpid will respond to SIGHUP
  by reloading the event handlers and\nreestablishing its connection to the acpid
  socket. Changes to the\nconfig file will require that uacpid be restarted, it will
  not\nreload the config on SIGHUP.\n\nHandler syntax closely follows that of acpid.
  Users familiar with\nacpid should have no problem here. An example is included.\n\nNote
  that uacpid requires acpid. It must be installed and running.\n\n(Please see the
  uacpid man page for more detailed info) \n\n\n## Getting source\n\n- Download the
  cabalized source package [from Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uacpid)\n-
  epub-tools is available for Arch Linux [from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/uacpid/)\n-
  Get the source with darcs: `$ darcs get http://hub.darcs.net/dino/uacpid`\n- If
  you're just looking, [browse the source](http://hub.darcs.net/dino/uacpid)\n\nGetting
  started developing:\n\nThis daemon is designed to make files for itself in ~/.uacpid/
  the\nfirst time it's run. To assist with development, there is a script\nwhich will
  build a development installation and execution environment\nin /tmp/uacpid-dev/
  for you.\n\nTo initialize for development:\n\n    $ bin/uacpid-dev-setup\n\n\nOnce
  that's completed, it can be run like this:\n\n    $ bin/uacpid-dev\n\nAnd once you
  have it, building the usual way:\n\n    $ cabal configure\n    $ cabal build\n    $
  cabal install\n\n\n## Installing\n\nBuild and install with cabal-install:\n  `$
  cabal update ; cabal install uacpid`\n\n\n## Contact\n\nDino Morelli <[dino@ui3.info](mailto:dino@ui3.info)>\n"
