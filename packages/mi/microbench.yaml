description: ! 'Microbenchmarking can be used to compare the speed of different

  approaches to the same operation.  Since most code is very fast, to

  get accurate timing information you must run the operation many times

  and then divide to get the time per operation.


  This library manages the microbenchmarking process: it finds how many

  iterations of a function are needed to get a good timing estimate per

  iteration and prints out a human-readable \"Your code takes /n/ nanoseconds

  to run, and can run /n/ times per second\".'
