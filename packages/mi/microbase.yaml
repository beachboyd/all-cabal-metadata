  This package is a hyper-minimal version of base-noprelude:
  It merely reexports some hardwired modules needed downstream while hiding most things.
  For example, ghcid will not work without @base:System.IO@.
  It also reexports all the "magic" classes that work with stock deriving.
  Ideally this package wouldn't be needed because @ghc-prim@ would contain everything hardwired,
  and base would just be an optional standard library.
