description: This package is a hyper-minimal version of base-noprelude. It merely
  reexports some hardwired modules needed downstream while hiding most things. For
  example, ghcid will not work without @base:System.IO@. It also reexports all the
  "magic" classes that work with stock deriving. Ideally this package wouldn't be
  needed because @ghc-prim@ would contain everything hardwired, and base would be
  replaceable.
