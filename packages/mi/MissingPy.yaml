description: ! "-------------------------\nWhat is MissingPy?\n-------------------------\n\nIt's
  two things:\n\n1. A Haskell binding for many C and Python libraries for tasks such
  as\n   data compression, databases, etc.  This can be found in the\n   MissingPy
  module tree.\n\n2. A low-level Haskell binding to the Python interpreter to\n   enable
  development of hybrid applications that use both\n   environments.  This can be
  found in the Python module tree.  The\n   Haskell bindings above use this environment.\n\nMissingPy
  permits you to call Python code from Haskell.  It does NOT\npermit you to call Haskell
  code from Python.\n\n-------------------------\nMajor Features\n-------------------------\n\n
  * GZip and BZip2 compression and decompression using the generic\n   Handle-like
  HVIO interface\n\n * *dbm persistent storage using the generic AnyDBM interface\n\n
  * Low-level interface to Python for extending your own Haskell code\n\n * Many unit
  tests to verify proper functionality\n\n** THIS IS CURRENTLY BETA-QUALITY CODE;
  MAJOR API FLUCTUATIONS MAY YET OCCUR.\n\n-------------------------\nQuick Start\n-------------------------\n\nSee
  the file INSTALL.\n\n-------------------------\nUsage in programs\n-------------------------\n\nYou
  can simply use -package MissingPy in ghc to enable\nthis library.  \n\nNote that
  you'll want to compile most of your programs with\n-fallow-overlapping-instances
  at least.  (If you use *only*\nMissingPy/*, that may not be necessary.)  Also, please
  note that you\nmust call Python.Interpreter.py_initialize before doing anything
  else.\n\nThe API docs can be built with \"make doc\", or you can find them at:\n\nhttp://software.complete.org/missingpy\n\n-------------------------\nAuthor
  & Homepage\n-------------------------\n\nMissingPy was written by John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>.\n\nThe
  latest version may be obtained at:\n\n   http://software.complete.org/missingpy\n\nDocumentation
  is also available on that page.\n\nThis program is copyrighted under the terms of
