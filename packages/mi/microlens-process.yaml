  # Revision history for microlens-process

  ## 0.2.0.0

  Final design - this will not change unless `System.Process` significantly changes.

  - `System.Process.Microlens.CommandSpec` is renamed to `System.Process.Microlens.CmdSpec` to be more flush with the data names
  - documentation improvements all around
  - Type signatures of combinators `inheriting`, `piping`, `handling` and `nostreaming` have had their unnecessary constraints dropped
  - `microlens-process` is now in lockstep featurewise
  - Traversals + Lenses have been added where in `lens-process` they would have been Prisms and Isos respectively. While it is slightly
    too powerful a constraint, the functionality is sound.

  ## 0.1.0.2

  GHC versions < 710 fail because applicative is not in base. Explicit import
  added where needed

  ## 0.1.0.1

  Fix the cabal version

  ## 0.1.0.0

  Expose a new module called `System.Process.Microlens.CommandSpec`, exposing
  traversals into the arguments of a raw command.

  Added doctests

  Improved docs

  ## 0.0.2.0

  Widen bounds, improve docs

  ## 0.0.1.1

  * Correct and widen version bounds

  ## 0.0.1.0

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # microlens-process

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/microlens-process.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-process)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emilypi/lens-process.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emilypi/lens-process)


  This package is intended to be on the lighter side, with few dependencies aside from `microlens`.


  ### Motivation

  `microlens-process` provides optics for the [process](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/process) package. These optics provide convenient lenses, as well as classy variants for significant classifiable portions of the library for convenience. In addition, we provide some combinators for working with `CreateProcess` types. The intention of this package is to create a well-typed optical layer for `process`, reflecting the shape of certain types of commands at the type level. For instance, consider the following:
