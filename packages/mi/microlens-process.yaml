  ### This package is still in Beta!

  This package is intended to be on the lighter side, with few dependencies aside from `microlens`.


  ### Motivation

  `microlens-process` provides optics for the [process](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/process) package. These optics provide convenient lenses, as well as classy variants for significant classifiable portions of the library for convenience. In addition, we provide some combinators for working with `CreateProcess` types. The intention of this package is to create a well-typed optical layer for `process`, reflecting the shape of certain types of commands at the type level. For instance, consider the following:
