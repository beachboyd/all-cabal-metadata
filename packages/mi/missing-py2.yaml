description: ! "# missing-py2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/domdere/missing-py2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/domdere/missing-py2)\n\nA
  fork of John Goerzen's [**MissingPy**] [softmechanics-missingpy]\n\nUpdated to run
  with **GHC 7.6.3** and run with **Python 2.7.3**, for maintaining projects with
  existing MissingPy dependencies.\n\nsee the original documentation for that project
  [**here**](./MissingPy.md).\n\n# Usage\n\nJust add `missing-py2` to your `build-depends`
  list, e.g:\n\n    build-depends:\n            base < 5 && >= 4\n        ,   missing-py2\n\nThe
  original documentation prescribes that the `OverlappingInstances` **GHC** extension
  is neccessary anywhere you use the `Python.*` modules.\n\nThat **may** be neccessary,
  however the unit tests seem to run fine without it now.\n\nDon't forget to run `py_initialize`
  from `Python.Interpreter` during the start up phase of your application\n\nRequires
  the `python-dev` libs, which can be installed on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install
  python-dev`.\n\n# See Also\n\n-   [**softmechanics/missingpy**] [softmechanics-missingpy]
  : The original project\n-   [**cpython**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cpython
  \"cpython on hackage\") : Another set of `libpython` bindings (looks more well-maintained),\n
  \   this would probably be preferable for new projects.\n\n\n[softmechanics-missingpy]:
