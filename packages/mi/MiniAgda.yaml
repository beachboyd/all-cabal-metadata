description: ! 'MiniAgda is a tiny dependently-typed programming language in the style

  of Agda. It serves as a laboratory to test potential additions to the

  language and type system of Agda. MiniAgda''s termination checker is a

  fusion of sized types and size-change termination and supports

  coinduction. Equality incorporates eta-expansion at record and

  singleton types. Function arguments can be declared as static; such

  arguments are discarded during equality checking and compilation.

  Recent features include bounded size quantification and destructor

  patterns for a more general handling of coinduction.'
