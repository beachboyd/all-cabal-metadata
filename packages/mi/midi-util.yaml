synopsis: Utility functions for processing MIDI files
changelog: |
  ## v0.2.1

    * add `timeSigAt` function

  ## v0.2.0.1

    * Semigroup fix for GHC 8.4 (requires `non-negative` 0.1.2 with same fix)

  ## v0.2

    * added `TimeSig` type and associated functions, so time signatures
      in a `MeasureMap` remember their denominators
      instead of e.g. converting 6/8 to 3/4

    * `unmakeTempoMap`, `unmakeMeasureMap`

    * relicensed as BSD3

    * note: the only change that necessitated a major version bump
      was the removal of the `Ord` instance for `TempoMap` and `MeasureMap`

  ## v0.1.1.1

    * fixed a bug in "extractFirst" (the time value returned was incorrect)

  ## v0.1.1

    * added `Eq`/`Ord`/`Show` instances to `TempoMap` and `MeasureMap`

    * `TempoMap` can go back to an event list of tempos,
      and `MeasureMap` can go back to an event list of time signatures

  ## v0.1

    * initial release

  Common high-level tasks when processing MIDI files.

  * Use tempos to translate between musical time (beats) and real time (seconds).

  * Use time signatures to reference positions using measures instead of just beats.

  * Find or change the names of MIDI tracks.
