synopsis: Utility functions for processing MIDI files
changelog: ! "## v0.2.1\n\n  * Semigroup fix for GHC 8.4 (requires `non-negative`
  0.1.2 with same fix)\n\n## v0.2\n\n  * added `TimeSig` type and associated functions,
  so time signatures\n    in a `MeasureMap` remember their denominators\n    instead
  of e.g. converting 6/8 to 3/4\n\n  * `unmakeTempoMap`, `unmakeMeasureMap`\n\n  *
  relicensed as BSD3\n\n  * note: the only change that necessitated a major version
  bump\n    was the removal of the `Ord` instance for `TempoMap` and `MeasureMap`\n\n##
  v0.1.1.1\n\n  * fixed a bug in \"extractFirst\" (the time value returned was incorrect)\n\n##
  v0.1.1\n\n  * added `Eq`/`Ord`/`Show` instances to `TempoMap` and `MeasureMap`\n\n
  \ * `TempoMap` can go back to an event list of tempos,\n    and `MeasureMap` can
  go back to an event list of time signatures\n\n## v0.1\n\n  * initial release\n"

  * Use tempos to translate between musical time (beats) and real time (seconds).


  * Use time signatures to reference positions using measures instead of just beats.
