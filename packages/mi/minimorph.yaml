description: ! 'A set of simplistic functions capturing the more regular

  parts of English spelling (for generation, not parsing).

  You will need to complement this with some account for

  irregular nouns/verbs. This package is not meant to provide

  anything resembling a full account of English morphology

  (something like Functional Morphology or sequor could be

  better suited). The main goal is to provide something cheap

  and cheerful with no learning curve, that you can use until

  your application calls for more robustness.

  See <https://github.com/Mikolaj/miniutter> for a simple

  use case.'
