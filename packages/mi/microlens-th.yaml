changelog: |
  # 0.4.2.3

  * Bumped template-haskell version.

  # 0.4.2.2

  * Bumped containers version.

  # 0.4.2.1

  * Fixed [lens bug #799](https://github.com/ekmett/lens/issues/799) (`makeFields` instances violate coverage condition).

  # 0.4.2

  * We now depend on `th-abstraction` (like `lens` itself).
  * Associated types are now supported.

  # 0.4.1.3

  * Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell again.

  # 0.4.1.2

  Skipped (the tarball got corrupted).

  # 0.4.1.1

  * Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell, as requested by @ocharles.

  # 0.4.1.0

  * Added `abbreviatedFields`.

  # 0.4.0.1

  * Ported a lens commit that (probably) makes lens generation deterministic. See [issue #83](https://github.com/aelve/microlens/issues/83).

  # 0.4.0.0

  * Added `makeClassy` (and `createClass`).

  # 0.3.0.2

  * Added forgotten copyright/authorship information.

  # 0.3.0.1

  * The library is now compatible with GHC 8.

  # 0.3.0.0

  * `SimpleGetter` and `SimpleFold` are no longer reexported.

  # 0.2.2.0

  * Moved `Getter` and `Fold` from this package to microlens (they're in `Lens.Micro.Extras`).

  # 0.2.1.3

  * Bumped template-haskell (so that the package would compile with GHC HEAD).

  # 0.2.1.2

  * Bumped microlens version to be able to use `phantom`.

  # 0.2.1.1

  * Bumped microlens version again.

  # 0.2.1.0

  * Bumped base version.
  * Bumped microlens version.

  # 0.2.0.0

  * `createClass` was removed because it doesn't seem to be useful without `lensClass`.
  * `defaultFieldRules` isn't exported anymore â€“ use `camelCaseFields`.

  # 0.1.2.0

  * Package now compiles with `-O2` and other optimisations by default.

  # 0.1.1.0

  * Added `makeLensesFor` (and `lensRulesFor`).

  # 0.1.0.1

  * Wrote a bit of documentation.

  # 0.1.0.0

  Initial release.

description: |-
  This package lets you automatically generate lenses for data types; code was extracted from the lens package, and therefore generated lenses are fully compatible with ones generated by lens (and can be used both from lens and microlens).

  This package is a part of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> family; see the readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>.
