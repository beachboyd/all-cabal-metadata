  # 0.4.1.1


  * Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell, as requested by @ocharles.


  # 0.4.1.0


  * Added `abbreviatedFields`.


  # 0.4.0.1


  * Ported a lens commit that (probably) makes lens generation deterministic. See

  # 0.2.2.0


  * Moved `Getter` and `Fold` from this package to microlens (they''re in `Lens.Micro.Extras`).


  # 0.2.1.3


  * Bumped template-haskell (so that the package would compile with GHC HEAD).


  # 0.2.1.2


  * Bumped microlens version to be able to use `phantom`.

  * Bumped microlens version again.


  # 0.2.1.0


  * Bumped base version.

  * Bumped microlens version.


  # 0.2.0.0

description: ! 'This package lets you automatically generate lenses for data types;
  code was extracted from the lens package, and therefore generated lenses are fully
  compatible with ones generated by lens (and can be used both from lens and microlens).


  This package is a part of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens>
  family; see the readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>.'
