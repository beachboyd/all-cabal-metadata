synopsis: Automatic generation of record lenses for microlens
changelog: ! '# 0.4.2


  * We now depend on `th-abstraction` (like `lens` itself).

  * Associated types are now supported.


  # 0.4.1.3


  * Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell again.


  # 0.4.1.2


  Skipped (the tarball got corrupted).


  # 0.4.1.1


  * Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell, as requested by @ocharles.


  # 0.4.1.0


  * Added `abbreviatedFields`.


  # 0.4.0.1


  * Ported a lens commit that (probably) makes lens generation deterministic. See
  [this issue](https://github.com/aelve/microlens/issues/83).


  # 0.4.0.0


  * Added `makeClassy` (and `createClass`).


  # 0.3.0.2


  * Added forgotten copyright/authorship information.


  # 0.3.0.1


  * The library is now compatible with GHC 8.


  # 0.3.0.0


  * `SimpleGetter` and `SimpleFold` are no longer reexported.


  # 0.2.2.0


  * Moved `Getter` and `Fold` from this package to microlens (they''re in `Lens.Micro.Extras`).


  # 0.2.1.3


  * Bumped template-haskell (so that the package would compile with GHC HEAD).


  # 0.2.1.2


  * Bumped microlens version to be able to use `phantom`.


  # 0.2.1.1


  * Bumped microlens version again.


  # 0.2.1.0


  * Bumped base version.

  * Bumped microlens version.


  # 0.2.0.0


  * `createClass` was removed because it doesn''t seem to be useful without `lensClass`.

  * `defaultFieldRules` isn''t exported anymore â€“ use `camelCaseFields`.


  # 0.1.2.0


  * Package now compiles with `-O2` and other optimisations by default.


  # 0.1.1.0


  * Added `makeLensesFor` (and `lensRulesFor`).


  # 0.1.0.1


  * Wrote a bit of documentation.


  # 0.1.0.0


  Initial release.

description: ! 'This package lets you automatically generate lenses for data types;
  code was extracted from the lens package, and therefore generated lenses are fully
  compatible with ones generated by lens (and can be used both from lens and microlens).
