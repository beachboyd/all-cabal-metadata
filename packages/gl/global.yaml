changelog: ! "PLACEHOLDER\n-----\n\n0.2.1.0\n-----\n* Add instances to `UDEmpty`.\n\n0.2.0.2\n-----\n*
  Add homepage and bug-reports to cabal file, linking to the github repository\n  and
  its issue tracker, respectively.\n\n0.2.0.1\n-----\n* Revise synopsis, because \"Haskell2010
  compatible\" suggests that both the\n  package and its dependencies don't require
  extensions, which is false.\n  Apologies for the misinformation!\n\n0.2.0.0\n-----\n*
  Support for `template-haskell-2.8.0.0`.\n* Drop support for Control.Concurrent.SampleVar,
  which is first removed in\n  `base-4.7.0.0`.  This entails a major API change, so
  one of the first two\n  components is incremented.\n* Replace `syntax-trees` dependency
  with fork called\n  `syntax-trees-fork-bairyn` that is able to be built.\n* Added
  `CHANGELOG.md`.\n"

description: ! 'The changelog does not cover every commit.  It outlines highlights
  and

  significant changes.


  Quality note: In late 2014, I found this repository on my hard drive from 2011.

  I''m surprised and don''t remember why I never uploaded this to Hackage.  As a

  relatively inexperienced 16-year-old with at most 2 years of functional

  programming experience (with much more procedural programming experience), I

  wrote Haskell code in a way that I now expect to be capable of rewriting with

  something of much better quality.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the

  quality of the documentation, taking into account my memory of my past self.

  Quality-wise, it seems better than a few other projects I wrote at around the

  same time, e.g. `monad-state`, although that was 6-12 months earlier.


  I''ve since converted the repository to git and uploaded it to github.  I''ve

  patched it up so that it builds, but nothing more yet (sans a few minor

  cleanups here and there, largely just in the cabal file, that I''m applying to

  each of my old projects I found).


  Contributions, feedback, and constructive criticism are welcome.
