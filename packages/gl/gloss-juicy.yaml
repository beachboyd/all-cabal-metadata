description: ! 'Lets you convert any image supported by Juicy.Pixels in a gloss application
  by converting to gloss'' Bitmap representation.


  Version 0.1.2 just enabled caching (from a frame to the next, and so on) of the
  images you load, so that they are not recomputed for each frame. Credits go to Jonathan
  Daugherty for the patch.'
