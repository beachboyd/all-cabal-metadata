description: ! '

  This is GlomeView, a graphical frontend to Glome, my raytracer.  Originally, Glome
  was a monolithic program, but I have now moved most of the internals to a couple
  of libraries, GlomeVec and GlomeTrace.


  GlomeView requires HOpenGL.


  This was one of the first things I wrote in Haskell.  As such, it has a few rough
  edges.
