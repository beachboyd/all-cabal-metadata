description: ! '''Data.Global'' provides a global namespace of ''IORef''s, ''MVar''s
  and

  ''TVar''s. This namespace may be accessed in pure code. Yet reading

  and writing to those ''IORef''s, ''MVar''s and ''TVar''s happens still in

  their respective monads.


  ''Data.Global'' is designed to meet the following use cases:


  * Simplify the declaration of top-level mutable variables, by

  avoiding any pragmas as well as ''unsafePerformIO''.


  * Avoid having to pass references explicitly throughout the

  program in order to let distant parts communicate.


  * Enable a communication by convention scheme, where

  e.g. different libraries may communicate without code

  dependencies.


  * Simplify the \"configuration problem\" - at least for code in the

  IO monad.


  Note, that this library does not encourage sloppy software design

  by re-introducing all bad effects of global

  variables. Nevertheless, sometimes global variables are a suitable

  solution to a problem. In that case "Data.Global" simplifies and

  extends their handling significantly.


  Examples are in the documentation of "Data.Global".
