description: ! "This is the vector library used by the Glome raytracer.  It has been
  separated \nout of the main Glome distribution as the beginning of an effort to
  separate \nall of the separately-useful modules in Glome.  (I have not yet removed
  the\nVec library from the main Glome distribution.)\n\nThis library may prove useful
  for graphics and computational geometry\nalgorithms.  It includes basic operations
  such as dot product, adding vectors,\netc, but it also includes transformations
  matricies and some useful operations\non axis-aligned bounding boxes such as clipping
  a ray to an AABB.   \n\nSee the Glome tutorial on the haskell wiki for details.\n\nThis
  was one of the first things I wrote in Haskell.  As such, it has a few\nrough edges.\n\nhttp://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Glome\n\nDirect
  all questions to:\nJim Snow\njsnow@cs.pdx.edu\n"
