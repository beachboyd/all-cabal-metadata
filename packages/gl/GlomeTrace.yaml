description: ! 'This is GlomeTrace, a ray tracing library.  Originally, it was part
  of Glome-hs, my haskell ray tracer.  I decided to pull out the code to trace rays
  against objects and distribute it as a stand-alone library so that other projects
  can use it.


  A good source of documentation is the Haskell wiki.  In particular, take a look
  at the tutorial I wrote for Glome-hs.  A few things have changed, but most of the
  descriptions there are still mostly valid.


  If you''re installing from a tarball, the usual commands will suffice:

  runhaskell Setup configure; runhaskell Setup build; runhaskell Setup install


  Note that GlomeTrace requires GlomeVec, a vector math library.
