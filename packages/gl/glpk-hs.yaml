description: |-
  Friendly interface to GLPK's linear programming and mixed integer programming features.  Intended for easy extensibility,
  with a general, pure-Haskell representation of linear programs.  Also includes usefully general algebraic structures.
  To design a linear programming problem,
  use "Control.Monad.LPMonad" to construct the constraints and specifications.  Linear functions are essentially specified
  as @Data.Map@s from variables to their coefficients, and functions for manipulating them are available in "Data.LinearProgram.LinExpr".
  Then "Data.LinearProgram.GLPK" provides facilities for using the GLPK solver system on your problem, with a sizable number
  of options available.
