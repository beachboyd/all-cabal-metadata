description: ! 'Friendly interface to GLPK''s linear programming and mixed integer
  programming features.  Intended for easy extensibility,

  with a general, pure-Haskell representation of linear programs.  Also includes usefully
  general algebraic structures.

  To design a linear programming problem,

  use "Control.Monad.LPMonad" to construct the constraints and specifications.  Linear
  functions are essentially specified

  as @Data.Map@s from variables to their coefficients, and functions for manipulating
  them are available in "Data.LinearProgram.LinExpr".

  Then "Data.LinearProgram.GLPK" provides facilities for using the GLPK solver system
  on your problem, with a sizable number

  of options available.'
