description: ! '`gsmenu` - a generic visual menu

  ================================


  `gsmenu` is a program that reads a list of entries from standard input

  (one per line) and provides a visual, grid-based interface from which

  the user can select one, with either mouse or keyboard.  The manual

  page contains full documentation.


  Installation

  ------------


  Assuming a working Cabal install, just do ''cabal install''.  Any

  missing dependencies will automatically be downloaded and installed.

  You may have to perform a ''cabal update'' first to ensure that your

  package list is up to date.


  Inspiration

  -----------


  This program is mostly a port of the GridSelect contrib for XMonad by

  Clemens Fruhwirth.


  Bugs

  ----


  Please report any found bugs to the maintainer at <athas@sigkill.dk>.
