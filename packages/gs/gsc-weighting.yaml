description: ! 'In their 1994 paper \"Volume Changes in Protein Evolution\",

  Gerstein, Sonnhammer and Chothia developed a weighting

  procedure for protein sequences to avoid over-represented

  sequences in the appendix \"A Method to Weight Protein

  Sequences to Correct for Unequal Representation\".  Although

  their method was developed for protein sequences, it is readily

  extended to work on any measurable set.


  This package calculates GSC weights for any reasonable

  dendrogram.  If you want to recreate their algorithm, then just

  use @UPGMA@ as linkage and residue identity as distance

  function when creating the dendrogram.


  Changes in version 0.2:


  * Updated to work with @hierarchical-clustering@ 0.4.


  Changes in version 0.1.1.1:


  * Use an stricter upper bound on @hierachical-clustering@.


  Changes in version 0.1.1:


  * Now works even when some (or all) branches have distance zero

  (i.e. elements below that branches are all equal with respect

  to distance metric that was used to create the dendrogram).'
