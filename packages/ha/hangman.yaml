description: ! 'A command line implementation of the classic hangman game.

  I wrote this when I was desperately bored during exam revision period

  in a couple of hours.

  Hopefully you will find the implementation to be of use. It sort of began as

  an assessment of the Haskell development experience, but I plan to continue

  to maintain and extend the implementation to demonstrate how to apply good

  software development practises to Haskell code.'
