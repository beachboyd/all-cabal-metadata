description: ! 'This is an early and mostly undocumented release of the 2.x version
  of hackage-db that''s intended mostly for experimenting with and testing of the
  new API. Porting code from 1.x to 2.x is pretty simple, but if you do that at this
  point, please expect minor details of this API to change in forthcoming releases.
  For production code, you are probably better off with the 1.x release for now.


  Check out https://github.com/peti/hackage-db/tree/master/example/ for a collection
  of simple example programs that demonstrate how to use this code.'
