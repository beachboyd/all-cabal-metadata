  A mid level applicative SQL generation library

  Haskqly intends to be a mid-level SQL generation library.  It doesn't use advanced type extensions
  to encode the schema in the types., but provides a light applicative layer to easy the conversion
  between haskell and SQL.  It is inspired by the clojures honeysql library.
