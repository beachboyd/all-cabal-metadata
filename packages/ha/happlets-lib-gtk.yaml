  *WARNING:* There are still some known bugs in this package, it is being

  uploaded to Hackage for evaluation purposes only. Although it is being

  actively developed, there is no release schedule for a production-ready

  version of this package. Contributions to the repository on GitHub are

  welcome.


  This packages provides the Gtk+ v2 back-end to the "happlets" GUI

  framework. To create a Gtk+ applet, import the "Happlets.Lib.Gtk"

  module. "Happlets.Lib.Gtk" re-exports the "Happlets" module, so you can

  use all of the primitives provided by the "Happlets" module to construct

  your applet. In your "main" function, launch the main event loop by

  passing the ''Happlets.Lib.Gtk.gtkHapplet'' function as the "Provider"

  either to the ''Happlets.Initialize.happlet'' function or to the

  ''Happlets.Initialize.simpleHapplet'' function.


  For an example of how to program your own Happlet, run the "cabal

  configure" command with the "--enable-tests" flag set. This will build

  the "Happlets.Lib.Gtk.TestSuite" executable program. Refer to the source

  code for "TestSuite" to see how the application is structured.


  The goal of the Happlets project is to allow you to create very simple,

  thread-safe applications that contain nothing more than a single window

  with a drawing canvas that can respond to user input events, like mouse

  clicks, key-presses, or frame animation events. The intention is to

  create a minimal programming platform for small, single-purpose

  graphical applications which simply displays some interactive graphic,

  for example a plot of some data, or a simple game. Naturally, the

  Happlet program can be arbitrarily complex, but it may be better to

  consider other, FRP-based solutions if managing events becomes too

  difficult.
