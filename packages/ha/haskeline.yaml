  0.6.4.3:\n   * Fix a bug on ghc-7.2.1 with tab-completion of Unicode filenames.\n\nChanged

  0.6.3:\n   * #111: Correct width calculations when the prompt contains newlines.\n\n

  vi-mode 'c' command with movements.\n\n   * #81: Correctly handle characters with
  a width > 1.\n\n   * Compatibility updates from the GHC folks for Solaris and for
  ghc-6.14.\n\n   * Optimization: if several key presses are input all at once (e.g.
  from a\n     paste), only display the last change.  This can also make Haskeline
  more\n     responsive when editing long lines.\n\n   * Hard-code some defaults for
  ctrl-left and ctrl-right, and provide the\n     corresponding Emacs bindings to
  skip words.\n\nChanged in version 0.6.2.2:\n   * Raise dependency to utf8-string>=0.3.6
  (fixes a bug when decoding invalid\n     input)\n\nChanged in version 0.6.2.1:\n
  \ Internal/API changes:\n   * Make sure to always use binary mode when expecting
  Char-as-byte.\n\n   * Eliminate unused import warnings on ghc>=6.11\n\n   * Increase
  upper bound on some dependencies for ghc-6.12\n\nChanged in version 0.6.2:\n\n  User
  interface changes:\n   * A multitude of new emacs and vi commands\n\n   * New preference
  'historyDuplicates' to prevent storage of duplicate lines\n\n   * Support PageUp
  and PageDown keys\n\n   * Let ctrl-L (clear-screen) work during getInputChar\n\n
  \ Internal/API changes:\n   * Compatibility with ghc-6.12\n\n   * Calculate the
  correct width for Unicode combining characters\n\n   * Removed RankNTypes requirement;
  added Rank2Types and UndecidableInstances\n\n   * Use simpleUserHooks instead of
  autoconfUserHooks in the Setup script\n\n   * Internal refactoring to make command
  declaration more flexible\n\n   * Read the .haskeline file completely before starting
  the UI (laziness issue)\n"

description: ! 'Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line

  programs.  This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since

  it is written in Haskell it is (hopefully) more easily used in other

  Haskell programs.


  Haskeline runs both on POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.'
