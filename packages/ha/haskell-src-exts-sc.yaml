description: ! "# haskell-src-exts-sc\n\nThe library generates code from `haskell-src-exts`
  AST.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n  1. pretty-print AST generated by `haskell-src-exts`\n
  \ 2. parse the generated code to get `SrcSpanInfo` for each node\n  3. combine AST
  annotated with comments and AST annotated with `SrcSpanInfo`\n  4. insert (non-empty)
  comments into each node, updating `SrcSpanInfo` of all nodes\n  5. profit!\n\nAs
  you can see, the algorithm is nor remarkably fast, because it prints and parses
  code\nand modifies `SrcSpanInfo` of all nodes in an AST on each comment insertion.\nOn
  the good side, it is quite flexible and compatible with many versions of `haskell-src-exts`.\nPerformance
  is also acceptable if you don't need to invoke it every millisecond.\n"
