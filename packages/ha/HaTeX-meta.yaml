description: ! "HaTeX-meta\r\n\r\nIf you want to use HaTeX-meta to generate HaTeX
  .Monad modules:\r\n1) Compile HaTeX-meta.\r\n2) Run it in a directory that contains
  the source of HaTeX, being the Text folder a subdirectory.\r\n\r\n** TODO\r\n\r\n-
  Documentation written in types is skipped.\r\n  We collect it in 'funArgsDoc' of
  FunDoc, but it is not used later.\r\n  Currently, the type is just pretty printed
  (see 'monadicFunction')."
