description: ! 'Hactor

  ======


  Hactor is a library which aims to provide lightweight actors similar to Erlang

  processes.


  This project is inspired by, and was originally a fork of

  [thespian](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/thespian), but I decided that it

  would be better and easier to just rewrite it.
