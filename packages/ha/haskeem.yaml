description: ! "This is haskeem, a small scheme interpreter. It lives on the web at\n\n
  \   http://www.korgwal.com/haskeem/\n\nYou should be able to build it with\n\n    cabal
  configure\n    cabal build\n\nOnce you have done so, find the haskeem executable
  and run it.\nAt the \"lisp> \" prompt, type (assuming you are still in the top-level\nhaskeem
  directory)\n\n    (load \"stdlib.scm\")\n    (load \"selftest.scm\")\n\nThe first
  command loads haskeem's standard library, and the second command\nruns the self-test.
  Assuming that all works, you can automate some of this:\ncopy the haskeem executable
  and the stdlib.scm file to some standard\nlocation(s), and then set the environment
  variable HASKEEM_INIT to the\nabsolute path of the stdlib.scm file. I store both
  the haskeem executable\nand the stdlib.scm file in /home/uwe/tools, which is in
  my PATH, and thus\nI set HASKEEM_INIT to /home/uwe/tools/stdlib.scm. Then I (and
  you) can launch\nhaskeem from any directory.\n\nIf you do not have haskeline installed,
  don't panic! There is an alternate\nversion of the main module in the file haskeem_readline.hs.
  That provides\neither a binding to the gnu readline library, or an alternate REPL
  with no\nline-editing capability at all. You'll need to rename this to haskeem.hs,\nedit
  it to select which of the two you want, and rebuild.\n\nSorry, no bindings to editline.\n\nEnjoy!\n"
