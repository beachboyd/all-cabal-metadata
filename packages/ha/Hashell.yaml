synopsis: Simple shell written in Haskell
changelog: ! "\n\tChangelog - Hashell (0.011a -> 0.013a)\n\n   -- Part of the parsing
  is now done with Parsec. \n   Parsec will partially substitute the majority of the
  parsing tasks.\n   -- Added a new exception handler for haskell expressions\n   evaluation.
  This fixes a bug that aborted hashell.\n   -- Added redirection of standard error.\n
  \  -- Fixed 'quit' built-in command bug.\n   -- Added number identifiers to the
  redirections operators.\n   -- Added pre-liminar support for environment variables.\n
  \  The support is contained into its own module.\n   -- Changed (_yet_ again) the
  syntax for sub-process evaluation \n   from '<|proc|>' to '(-proc-)' (without the
  quotes).\n   -- Type constraints for haskell expressions evaluations are now limited\n
  \  to the ':<s,p,n,u>' notation. Values:\n   \t's' String without newline.\n\t'p'
  Non-String with newline.\n\t'n' Non-String without newline.\n\t'u' String with newline.\n
  \  -- The 'execSplitToken' function has been re-written. It is now\n   split into
  several smaller functions and with better exception handling\n   support.\n   --
  Hashell will now automatically read the configuration file with name\n   .hashell_config
  if it exists inside HOME.\n   -- The comments format in the hashell configuration
  file has changed\n   from '*' to '-'.\n   -- The command composition feature was
  removed.\n   -- Others smaller bugs have been fixed too.\n\n\tAuthor: Luis F. Araujo\n\t\tluis@arjox.org\nSat

description: ! "Hashell : A Haskell shell\n-----------------------------------------\nVersion:
  0.014a\nStatus: Alpha\n\nDependencies:\n\n*The Glasgow Haskell Compiler\n     >=
  6.8 <http://haskell.org/ghc>\n*Cabal\n     (any version should work fine; <http://haskell.org/cabal>)\n*Parsec\n
  \    >= 1.0 <http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/parsec.html>\n\nYou can build and install
  Hashell like any other Haskell package, through Cabal; the following example installs
  as the current user to one's ~/bin directory, but to install elsewhere or as root,
  simply change the directories or remove the --user flags, respectively:\n\n   $
  runhaskell Setup configure --verbose=2 --user --prefix=$HOME/bin --datadir=$HOME/bin/share\n
  \  $ runhaskell Setup build\n   $ runhaskell Setup install --user;\n\nYou need to
  have Cabal installed in your system.\nCabal will often be part of your GHC installation,
  but you can get a stand-alone version of Cabal from <http://haskell.org/cabal>.\n\nNOTE!
  The current version of Hashell assumes you have GHC 6.8.2 installed, and that the
  output of 'ghc --print-libdir' = \"/usr/lib/ghc-6.8.2/\". If that's not the right
  directory, you must edit Hashell/Eval.hs and update the constant 'ghcPath'.\n\nUsage:\n\n
  \  $ hashell\n\n   or\n\n   $ hashell -c <configurationfile>\n\nYou always can use
  the --help option for further help.\n\n   $ hashell --help\n\nThe syntax is still
  fluid, but roughly, ';' is a terminator; an expression starting with ':' will be
  treated as a load-file command; one starting with \"quit\" will exit Hashell; one
  starting with \"cd\" will change the working directory; and an expression enclosed
  in a \"!()\" will be passed through the GHC API and evaluated as an arbitrary Haskell
  expression. All other commands should be treated as programs to be run.\n\nLicense:\n
