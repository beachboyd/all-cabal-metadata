changelog: ! "0.8.0.1\n- Bump base and template-haskell library to versions shipped
  with GHC 7.6.\n\n0.8\n- Compatibility with GHC 8.2.\n- Remove deprecated modules.\n\n0.7.0.1\n-
  Fixed a bug that caused deriving clauses to be ignored on TH 2.11.\n\n0.7.0\n- Compatibility
  with haskell-src-exts 1.18.\n- Support dropped for GHC < 7.6 and haskell-src-exts
  < 1.17.\n\n0.6.0.14:\n- Compatibility with GHC 8.0.\n\n0.6.0.13:\n- Compatibility
  with GHC HEAD, haskell-src-exts 1.17\n- Remove hsBindsToDecs, since it was redundant
  with toDecs. Technically this\n  requires a minor-version bump, but I doubt anyone
  was using it.\n\n0.6.0.12:\n- Support th-orphans 0.13\n\n0.6.0.11:\n- Support syb
  0.6\n\n0.6.0.10:\n- Support syb 0.5, th-orphans 0.12\n\n0.6.0.9:\n- Compatibility
  with GHC 7.10\n- Update th-orphans dependency\n- Drop GHC < 7.4 support (actually
  it was already broken, since HSE 1.16\n  requires base >= 4.5)\n\n0.6.0.8:\n- Move
  to HSE 1.16\n\n0.6.0.7:\n- Fix compilation oops\n\n0.6.0.6:\n- Move to HSE 1.15,
  adding support for multiway if\n\n0.6.0.5:\n- Update th-orphans dependency\n\n0.6.0.4:\n-
  Drop support for GHC 6.12\n- Move to HSE 1.14\n\n0.6.0.3:\n- Update th-orphans dependency\n-
  Some dependency loosening in anticipation of GHC 7.8\n\n0.6.0.2:\n- Update syb dependency\n\n0.6.0.1:\n-
  Fix haddock parse error\n\n0.6:\n- Cabal category Template Haskell\n- Partial support
  for list comprehensions\n- Support for type and data families and class decs\n-
  Split orphan instances into new package th-orphans\n  - above changes courtesy of
  mgsloan\n  - L.H.TH.Instances.Lift now deprecated\n- Removed L.H.M.Utils.deriveLiftPretty,
  dropped th-lift dependency\n- Rename L.H.M.Utils.unQ to unsafeRunQ\n- instance ToName
  Op\n- Support for unboxed tuple types and kind signatures\n- Compatibility with
  GHC 7.6.1, bringing support for kind variables\n  and infix declarations\n\n0.5.1.2:\n-
  More sensible determination of TH version available\n\n0.5.1.1:\n- View pattern
  support, thanks to Nicolas Frisby.\n\n0.5.1:\n- New module Language.Haskell.Meta.Parse.Careful,
  written by Reiner Pope\n  so that ambiguous parses can be rejected instead of quietly
  done wrong.\n\n0.5.0.3:\n- Support for GHC 7.4, thanks to Reiner Pope\n- Support
  for unresolved infix expressions, again thanks to Reiner Pope\n\n0.5.0.2:\n- Fixed
  bug in translation of tuple constructors\n\n0.5.0.1:\n- Added support for primitive
  string literals (Only in TH >= 2.5)\n\n0.5:\n- Added support for instance declarations\n\n0.4.0.2:\n-
  Compatibility with GHC 7.2\n\n0.4.0.1:\n- Deprecate myDefaultParseMode and myDefaultExtensions
  in L.H.M.Parse\n\n0.4:\n- Remove Language.Haskell.Meta.Syntax.Vars and the L.H.M.Syntax
  re-export module\n- Remove dependency on containers\n- Add support for let statements
  in (pattern) guards\n- Add support for negative patterns\n- Remove \"support\" for
  SpliceExps that didn't really make sense\n- Improve many error messages where things
  are unimplemented or impossible\n\n0.3:\n- Fixes/additions to inline pragma support
  (Jonas Duregard)\n- Compatibility with GHC 7 and TH 2.5 - totalling three major
  versions!\n- Move some of the quasiquoters to their own package, and stop exporting\n
  \ the rest (they are kept as examples of usage)\n\n0.2:\n- Compatibility with GHC
  6.10 and TH 2.3 (Geoffrey Mainland)\n- Add support for do-blocks, pattern guards
  (Adam Vogt)\n- Add applicative-do quasiquoter (Adam Vogt)\n\n0.1.1:\n- Add support
  for inline pragmas, and improve support for type\n  signatures (patch by Jonas Duregard)\n\n0.1.0:\n-
  Used the th-lift library to autogenerate the instances of Lift in\n  Language.Haskell.TH.Instances.Lift\n-
  Added support for the new features of template-haskell-2.4.0.0:\n  contexts, kinds,
  bang patterns, unboxed word literals.\n- Updated use of haskell-src-exts in response
  to API changes.\n- Added ToDecs class because some HSE Decls don't map to a single
  Dec.\n  (patch by Jonas Duregard)\n\n0.0.6:\n- last version released by Matt Morrow
  before his disappearance\n"

description: ! 'The `haskell-src-meta` Package  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/haskell-src-meta.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-meta)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mainland/haskell-src-meta.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mainland/haskell-src-meta)

  ==================


  `haskell-src-meta` is a package originally by Matt Morrow for converting a

  parsed AST from `haskell-src-exts` to a TH AST for use in splices and

  quasiquoters. The last version Matt released before he disappeared from the

  Haskell community was 0.0.6, but by that time his library was already popular,

  so some community members eventually decided to take over maintenance of the

  package, keeping it up to date with the latest versions of TH etc.


  I don''t really view this as "my" package so if you want write access to

  the github repository, or you think you could do a better job as

  maintainer, just ask.
