synopsis: A documentation-generation tool for Haskell libraries
changelog: ! "## Changes in version 2.21.0\n\n * Overhaul handling of data declarations
  in XHTML and LaTeX. Adds support for\n   documenting individual arguments of constructors/patterns
  (#709)\n\n * Actually list all fixities for `--hoogle` (#871)\n\n * Fix broken instance
  source links (#869)\n\n * Avoiding line breaks due to ling line in the output of
  `--hoogle` (#868)\n\n * Capture docs on type family instances (#867)\n\n## Changes

  meta data too, breaking the API\n\n * parser: markdown syntax for images and URLs
  is now accepted:\n   <<foo>> style for images and <foo bar> style for links is now\n
  \  considered deprecated. <foo> for links is still OK.\n\n * parser: add support
  for @since element: this is paragraph-level\n   element of the form ‘@since x.y.z’

  slight\n   parsing performance boost.\n\n * Move development to be against latest
  GHC release and not GHC HEAD.\n\n * Further split up the package to separate the
  executable from the\n   library, necessary by things like GHCJS. We now have\n   ‘haddock-library’
  which are the parts that don't use GHC API,\n   ‘haddock-api’ which are (some of)
  the parts that do use GHC API and\n   ‘haddock’ which merely provides the executable.\n\n

  Changes in version 2.2.1:\n\n  * Support for GHC 6.8.3\n\n  * The Hoogle backend
  is back, thanks to Neil Mitchell. The plan is to be\n    compatible with the upcoming
  Hoogle 4 pre-release\n\n  * Show associated types in the documentation for class
  declarations\n\n  * Show type family declarations\n\n  * Show type equality predicates\n\n
  \ * Major bug fixes (#1 and #44)\n\n  * It is no longer required to specify the
  path to GHC's lib dir\n\n  * Remove unnecessary parenthesis in type signatures\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 2.1.0:\n\n  * Fix a bug that made links point to the defining
  module instead\n    of the \"best\" one (e.g Int pointing to GHC.Base instead of
  Data.Int)\n\n  * Fix a couple of smaller bugs\n\n  * The representation of DocName
  was changed in the library\n\n  * Add a flag --no-warnings for turning off warnings\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 2.0.0.0:\n\n  * The GHC API is used as the front-end\n\n  * Haddock
  now understands all syntax understood by GHC 6.8.2\n\n  * Haddock can generate documentation
  for some of the language extensions\n    in GHC 6.8.2\n\n  * Format of module attributes
  has changed. The only way of specifying\n    module attributes is via a new OPTIONS_HADDOCK
  pragma. Example:\n    {-# OPTIONS_HADDOCK hide, prune #-}\n\n  * Haddock understands
  literate source files\n\n  * Add a small library to read Haddock's interface files\n\n
  \ * Add a flag -B for passing the path to the GHC lib dir\n\n  * Add a flag --optghc
  for passing options to GHC\n\n  * Add a flag --ghc-version for printing the GHC
  version\n\n  * Remove --use-package, --allow-missing-html, --ghc-pkg, in favour
  of only\n    supporting --read-interface\n\n  * Remove --package flag, the GHC flag
  -package-name can be used instead\n\n  * Remove --no-implicit-prelude flag, the
  GHC flag -XNoImplicitPrelude can\n    be used instead\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 0.9:\n\n  * Infix type operators, e.g., first :: a~>a' -> (a,b)~>(a',b)\n\n
  \ * Add a search box to the index page which automatically narrows\n    the index
  to the search as you type (thanks to Neil Mitchell).\n\n  * Add a --ghc-pkg flag\n\n
  \ * Add a flag --allow-missing-html\n\n  * URL expansion for %%, %L, %{LINE}\n\n
  \ * added substitution %{FILE///c}\n\n  * Lexing of /.../ is now more like '...',
  in that a / character must\n    be matched by another / character on the same line,
  otherwise it\n    is treated as a literal '/'.  This removes a common source of\n
  \   accidental parse errors in documentation.\n\n  * Various bugs were fixed.\n\n
  \ * Cabal 1.2 is now required, and Haddock builds with GHC 6.8.x.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 0.8:\n\n  * Haddock has a Cabal build system, and will build
  on Windows without\n    Cygwin or MSYS.  GHC 6.4 or later is required.\n\n  * New
  options: --comments-base, --comments-module, --comments-entity\n    for generating
  links to pages (eg. wiki) for collecting user comments.\n\n  * New options: --source-base,
  --source-module, --source-entity\n    for generating links to source code.  Haddock
  now understands\n    {-# LINE #-} pragmas, which means it can figure out the correct\n
  \   name for the source file even if the file is preprocessed.\n\n  * Haddock generates
  output for populating the Hoogle search engine.\n\n  * New markup <<url>> for including
  images.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 0.7:\n\n  * ## Changes in the way Haddock decides where to direct
  hyperlinks.  Each entity\n    is now assigned a single \"home\" module, and all
  hyperlinks are directed\n    to that module.  See the docs (\"Hyperlinking and re-exported
  entities\")\n    for details.\n\n  * New options --ignore-all-exports, --hide\n\n
  \ * New option --use-package for creating documentation that hyperlinks to\n    the
  HTML documentation for existing packages on your system.  It works\n    by querying
  ghc-pkg for the location of the Haddock interface and\n    HTML for the given package.\n\n
  \ * Parts of the HTML documentation, notably lists of instances, are\n    now \"collapsible\"
  with a +/- button.  Also, the contents page is now\n    in the form of tree in which
  subtrees can be collapsed.\n\n  * Support for Microsoft DevHelp and HtmlHelp 2.0
  formats.\n\n  * Support for a short description for each module for the contents
  page.\n\n  * Compiles with GHC 6.4+\n\n  * Various bugfixes\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 0.6:\n\n  * Implicit parameters, zip comprehensions and 'mdo'
  are now\n    supported by the parser.\n\n  * Some lexical bugs were fixed, mainly
  concerning literal paragraphs\n    next to non-literal paragraphs.\n\n  * New options:
  \ --gen-index, --use-index, --gen-contents and --use-contents,\n    for generting
  a combined index and contents for several libraries\n    from the appropriate .haddock
  files.\n\n  * There is now one index rather than separate Function/Constructor and\n
  \   Type/Class indices.  Where a name refers to several entities, these\n    are
  listed separately in the index.\n\n  * New option: -v, elicits more verbose warnings.
  \ Some warnings are\n    now turned off by default; Haddock should be a little less
  noisy\n    in general.\n\n  * Markup for definition lists has been added.  See the
  documentation\n    for details.\n\n  * New option: --package for setting the package
  name.  The package\n    is listed alongside each module name in the combined contents.\n\n
  \ * Entities which are re-exported from another package now at least\n    leave
  a hyperlink in the generated HTML, rather than nothing at all.\n\n  * Some fixes
  for bugs which caused incorrect hyperlinks in the\n    generated HTML.  In particular,
  instances should now be linked\n    correctly.\n\n  * Some aesthetic improvements
  to the generated HTML.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 0.5:\n\n  * Compiles with recent versions of GHC.\n\n  * A few
  bugs have been fixed.\n\n  * New labelling/linking feature (see \"Anchors\" in the
  manual).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##
  Changes in version 0.4:\n\n  * Import declarations which list entities in parentheses,
  or with\n    hiding clauses, are now properly supported.  Modulo one or two\n    small
  infelicities, the full Haskell modules system is now supported.\n\n  * Haddock is
  now more flexible about the placing of separators\n    (commas, semicolons) in relation
  to doc comments.\n\n  * There is support for generating and reading \"interface
  files\"\n    which describe the exports of a set of modules.  This is useful\n    for
  generating documentation which hyperlinks to\n    previously-generated documentation.\n\n
  \ * Support for generating the extra files required by the Microsoft\n    Help compiler.\n\n
  \ * New option: --prologue specifies a file of documentation which is\n    placed
  on the contents page.\n\n  * Many bugs fixed\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n##
  Changes in version 0.3:\n\n  * Documentation on individual function arguments is
  now implemented\n\n  * Links can be made to identifiers that aren't in scope, by
  using\n    the fully qualified name.\n\n  * Instances are collected and listed with
  the appropriate classes\n    and datatypes (not for derived instances yet).\n\n
  \ * Single quotes are only interpreted specially when they surround a\n    legal
  Haskell identifier, otherwise they are treated literally.\n\n  * Bird-tracked text
  is now literal.  If you want marked-up text in\n    a code block, use the @...@
  notation instead.\n\n  * Various changes to the layout, it generally looks nicer
  now.\n\n  * Various bugs fixed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n##
  Changes in version 0.2:\n\n  * The [...] markup for typewriter font has been changed
  to @...@.\n\n  * Module attributes introduced (see the documentation for details).\n\n
  \ * {- ... -} style comments may now be used for documentation annotations\n\n  *
  Recursive modules are detected and reported as an error.\n\n  * Existential constructors
  and rank-N types are now groked by the parser\n\n  * Some type rendering cleaned
  up\n\n  * `abc' is accepted as well as 'abc' to markup an identifier\n\n  * Several
  bugs fixed, and error messages improved.\n"

description: ! "# Haddock, a Haskell Documentation Tool [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/haddock.svg?branch=ghc-8.6)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/haddock)\n\n\n##
  About haddock\n\nSee [Description on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock).\n\n##
  Source code documentation\n\nFull documentation can be found in the `doc/` subdirectory,
  in\n[reStructedText format](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html)\nformat.\n\n\n##
  Project overview\n\nThis project consists of three packages:\n\n* haddock\n* haddock-api\n*
  haddock-library\n\n### haddock\n\nThe haddock package provides the `haddock` executable.
  It is implemented as a\ntiny wrapper around haddock-api's `Documentation.Haddock.haddock`
  function.\n\n### haddock-api\n\nhaddock-api contains the program logic of the `haddock`
  tool. [The haddocks for\nthe `Documentation.Haddock` module](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock-api-2.19.0.1/docs/Documentation-Haddock.html)\noffer
  a good overview of haddock-api's functionality.\n\n### haddock-library\n\nhaddock-library
  is concerned with the parsing and processing of the Haddock\nmarkup language.\n\n\n##
  Contributing\n\nPlease create issues when you have any problems and pull requests
  if you have some code.\n\n## Hacking\n\nTo get started you'll need a latest GHC
  release installed.\n\nClone the repository:\n\n```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/haskell/haddock.git\n
  \ cd haddock\n```\n\nand then proceed using your favourite build tool.\n\n#### Using
  [`cabal new-build`](http://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nix-local-build-overview.html)\n\n```bash\ncabal
  new-build -w ghc-8.6.1\n# build & run the test suite\ncabal new-test -w ghc-8.6.1
  all\n```\n\n#### Using Cabal sandboxes\n\n```bash\ncabal sandbox init\ncabal sandbox
  add-source haddock-library\ncabal sandbox add-source haddock-api\ncabal sandbox
  add-source haddock-test\n# adjust -j to the number of cores you want to use\ncabal
  install -j4 --dependencies-only --enable-tests\ncabal configure --enable-tests\ncabal
  build -j4\n# run the test suite\nexport HADDOCK_PATH=\"dist/build/haddock/haddock\"\ncabal
  test\n```\n\n#### Using Stack\n\n```bash\nstack init\nstack install\n# run the test
  suite\nexport HADDOCK_PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin/haddock\"\nstack test\n```\n\n###
  Git Branches\n\nIf you're a GHC developer and want to update Haddock to work with
  your\nchanges, you should be working on `ghc-head` branch.\nSee instructions at\nhttps://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/WorkingConventions/Git/Submodules\nfor
  an example workflow.\n\n### Updating `html-test`\n\nWhen accepting any changes in
  the output of `html-test`, it is important\nto use the `--haddock-path` option.
  For example:\n\n```\ncabal new-run -- html-test --haddock-path $(find dist-newstyle/
  -executable -type f -name haddock) --accept\n```\n"
