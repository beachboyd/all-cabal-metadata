  The purpose of this library is to generate okay-looking bar plots
  for you without much effort on your part. The style of the plots
  may change in newer releases as we find ways to make them look
  nicer. If happy-hour generates a plot for you that is not
  aesthetically pleasing, please let us know so that we may improve.
