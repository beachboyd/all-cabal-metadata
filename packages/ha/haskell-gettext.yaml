description: ! "haskell-gettext README\n======================\n\nThis package is
  pure Haskell implementation of GetText library runtime.\nIt allows you to:\n\n*
  Load GNU Gettext binary catalog files (`.mo`, `.gmo`).\n* Execute lookups for messages
  in catalog (gettext and ngettext functions).\n\nSupport for plural form selection
  expressions is fully implemented.\n\nThis package is however relatively low-level
  and may be not very nice to\nuse in applications. So it can be used as a backend
  for some more user-friendly\n\"translation framework\".\n\nThis package has the
  following advantages comparing to hgettext:\n\n* It is easier to build it on different
  platforms, since it has no dependency on \n  C code;\n* It does not depend on additional
  C libraries in runtime;\n* And probably the most important: this library does not
  use global process-level\n  variables to store \"current catalog\" (current locale),
  the catalog should be\n  specified for each call of translation function. So it
  can be much simpler to\n  use this library for example in web applications.\n\n"
