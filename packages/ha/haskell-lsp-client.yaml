  This package is intended for developers of text editors who want to make their text
  editor

  compatible with the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md).


  I have developed this package with plans to integrate it in the [Yi editor](https://github.com/yi-editor/yi).


  ## The example client


  Contained in this repository is an example client. This example client just runs
  the [Haskell IDE Engine](https://github.com/alanz/haskell-ide-engine/)

  and opens the file specified on the command line. Then it waits a second to let
  HIE check the

  file for errors and such.


  To run the example:


  1. Download and install the Haskell IDE Engine. (make sure `hie` is on your PATH)

  2. `git clone https://github.com/noughtmare/haskell-lsp-client`

  3. `cd haskell-lsp-client`

  4. `stack build`

  5. `stack exec example-client -- example/Main.hs`


  On my system it shows something about a capability registration request and that
  a certain hoogle

  database is used. You can replace example/Main.hs with any haskell file you would
  like to check.

  It reports ghc errors and hlint suggestions.
