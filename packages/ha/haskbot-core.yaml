description: ! "# Haskbot\n\n### An easily-extensible, Haskell-based Slack chatbot\n\nThe
  purpose of this little bot is to provide:\n\n- a slew of mini-services for [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com/)\n-
  a simple platform for Bendyworkers to learn Haskell\n- a playground for exciting
  Haskell web modules, such as WAI, Warp, and Aeson\n\nThis `README` only demonstrates
  how to setup a Haskell dev environment for\ncreating Haskbot plugins. Further documentation
  can be found on\n[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskbot-core).\n\n###
  New to Haskell?\n\nI find enjoyment of Haskell is greatly increased by a thorough
  reading of the\nfirst few chapters of [Learn You a Haskell...](http://learnyouahaskell.com).
  Of\ncourse, I highly recommend the entire book when you've time.\n\nIf you're an
  in-house Bendyworker, I'm also available before/after hours or\nduring growth time
  to help or answer any questions.\n\n### Installing the Haskell Platform and Haskbot\n\nTo
  run Haskbot locally, all you require is the latest Haskell platform. If your\ndistro
  of choice isn't\n[Debian](http://www.extellisys.com/articles/haskell-on-debian-wheezy),\nthis
  means your package manager probably provides it for you.\n\n1. Run the following
  to install the platform:\n   - On Ubuntu\n\n     ```sh\n     sudo apt-get update\n
  \    sudo apt-get install haskell-platform\n     ```\n   - On OSX (via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))\n\n
  \    ```sh\n     brew update\n     brew install haskell-platform\n     ```\n\n2.
  Add Cabal's (the Haskell package manager) `bin` folder to your shell's\n   `$PATH`.
  This is usually done by adding the following lines to\n   `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`
  (whichever you have/prefer).\n   ```sh\n   PATH=\"$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH\"\n   export
  PATH\n   ```\n   Make sure to re-source whatever file contains the new `$PATH`,
  like so:\n   ```sh\n   source ~/.profile\n   ```\n3. Update the Haskell packages
  via:\n\n   ```sh\n   cabal update\n   cabal install cabal-install\n   cabal install
  haskbot-core\n   ```\n\n### Creating Plugins\n\nYou're now ready to begin creating
  plugins for your very own Haskbot! Continue\non to [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskbot-core)
  for a full\nHaskbot API description and examples.\n\n### Thanks\n\nI wouldn't have
  had time to write this without the growth time supplied by\n[Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com/).
  Hey, employers! This is what developers\nneed to survive.\n\n### License\n\nSee
  `LICENSE.txt`\n"
