description: ! "# haskell-src-exts-simple\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThis package provides
  a shim for haskell-src-exts, exposing the same\nAST but without annotations, using
  ghc's pattern synonyms.\n\nThis package is useful for synthesizing and manipulating
  HSE ASTs\nthat don't carry source location information. It may also aid\nin porting
  packages from haskell-src-exts 1.17 to 1.18, but it\nis *not* a drop-in replacement
  for the old annotation-free AST.\nSee the Compatibility section for details.\n\n##
  Versioning\n\nTo be able to track the haskell-src-exts version numbers conveniently,\nthe
  first *three* components of the version will be treated as the\nmajor version, followed
  by the minor version as usual. This deviates\nfrom the PVP.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n###
  Comparison to haskell-src-exts 1.17 (as of version 1.18):\n\nhaskell-src-exts-simple
  provides a simplified view of the annotated\nAST in haskell-src-exts, so there are
  differences to the unannotated\nAST provided by earlier versions of haskell-src-exts:\n\n*
  some constructors carried `SrcLoc` information, which is no longer\n  available,
  notably\n  - most constructors of the `Decl`, `ModulePragma`, `ImportDecl`,\n   `IPBind`,
  `ClassDecl`, `InstDecl`, `QualConDecl`, `GadtDecl`\n    datatypes\n  - the `Lambda`,
  `ExpTypeSig` and `Proc` constructors of the `Exp`\n    type (and a few XML related
  ones)\n  - the `Generator` constructor of `Stmt`\n  - the `Alt` constructor of `Alt`\n
  \ - the `PatTypeSig` constructor of `Pat`\n* the second, fourth and fifth fields
  of the `Module` constructor have\n  been combined into a single field of type `ModuleHead`\n\n(this
  list is probably incomplete)\n\n### ghc compatibility\n\n* haskell-src-exts-simple
  requires ghc-7.8 or later\n* Note that with ghc-7.8, the constructors of the\n  `Language.Haskell.Exts.Simple.Syntax.Literal`
  type are only\n  available for pattern matching, because construction relies on\n
  \ explicitly bidirectional pattern synonyms for literals. For ghc-7.8\n  compatibility,
  you should use the `*L` (`intL` etc.) functions for\n  constructing `Literal` values.\n*
  Support for record pattern synonyms was added in ghc-8.0. Therefore,\n  with ghc-7.10
  and earlier, the constructor of the\n  `Language.Haskell.Exts.Simple.Syntax.ImportDecl`
  type is exported as\n  a plain constructor, and the selectors as functions.\n"
