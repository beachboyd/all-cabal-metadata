description: ! "# PostgreSQL Migrations for Haskell\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/tvh/hasql-migration.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tvh/hasql-migration)\n\nWelcome
  to hasql-migrations, a tool for helping you with\nPostgreSQL schema migrations.
  This is a port of\n[postgresql-simple-migration](https://github.com/ameingast/postgresql-simple-migration)\nfor
  use with hasql.\n\n## Why?\nDatabase migrations should not be hard. They should
  be under version control\nand documented in both your production systems and in
  your project files.\n\n## What?\nThis library executes SQL/Haskell migration scripts
  and keeps track of their\nmeta information.\n\nScripts are be executed exactly once
  and any changes to scripts will cause\na run-time error notifying you of a corrupted
  database.\n\nThe meta information consists of:\n* an MD5 checksum of the executed
  script to make sure already existing\n  scripts cannot be modified in your production
  system.\n* a time-stamp of the date of execution so you can easily track when a
  change\n  happened.\n\nThis library also supports migration validation so you can
  ensure (some)\ncorrectness before your application logic kicks in.\n\n## How?\nTODO\n\n##
  Compilation and Tests\nThe program is built with the _cabal_ build system. The following
  command\nbuilds the library, the standalone binary and the test package.\n\n```bash\ncabal
  configure --enable-tests && cabal build -j\n```\n\nTo execute the tests, you need
  a running PostgreSQL server with an empty\ndatabase called _test_. Tests are executed
  through cabal as follows:\n\n```bash\ncabal configure --enable-tests && cabal test\n```\n\nTo
  build the project in a cabal sandbox, use the following code:\n\n```bash\ncabal
  sandbox init\ncabal install -j --only-dependencies --enable-tests --disable-documentation\ncabal
  configure --enable-tests\ncabal test\n```\n\nTo remove the generated cabal sandbox,
  use:\n```bash\ncabal sandbox delete\n```\n\n## To Do\n* Collect executed scripts
  and check if already executed scripts have been\n  deleted.\n"
