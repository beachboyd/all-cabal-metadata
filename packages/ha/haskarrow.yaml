description: This haskell preprocessor will allow you to write "haskarrow" code.  Haskarrow
  is a semi-impertive language.  In a normal imperitive language evaluation happens
  top to bottom.  In haskarrow, each command is given a set of dependencies.  Commands
  are then excecuted in order of dependency resolution, those commands that have the
  fewest dependencies comming before those with the most.
