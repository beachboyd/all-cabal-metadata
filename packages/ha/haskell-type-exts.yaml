description: ! 'Haskell Types with Extensions (HTE, haskell-type-exts)

  is (an embryo of) a type checker for Haskell as embodied

  syntactically by the haskell-src-exts (HSE) package.

  At this point the type checker only handles a limited

  number of extensions, both regarding the various syntactic

  extensions handled by HSE, and the various type-level

  extensions implemented in e.g. GHC. The goal is to

  cover the full range of known Haskell extensions,

  but every path starts with a first step.'
