description: ! 'Time Range

  ==========


  Found the need to be able to create a time range in list form.


  Ended up writing a bunch of new types, functions, and some prisms, so here we are.


  Suggestions for the API, types, extra granularity or other such things is encouraged
  and

  appreciated. This is very much a WIP in library as it was created for a very specific
  need, but

  I thought others might find it useful.
