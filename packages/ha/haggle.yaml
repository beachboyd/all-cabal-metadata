description: |-
  This library provides mutable (in ST or IO), immutable, and inductive graphs.
  There are multiple graphs implementations provided to support different use
  cases and time/space tradeoffs.  It is a design goal of haggle to be flexible
  and allow users to "pay as they go".  Node and edge labels are optional.  Haggle
  also aims to be safer than fgl: there are no partial functions in the API.
