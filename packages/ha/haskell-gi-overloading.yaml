description: ! 'Bindings generated by [haskell-gi](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi)
  are by default compiled with support for [OverloadedLabels](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/wiki/Overloading).


  This support for `OverloadedLabels` comes at a cost in compile time, which can be
  significant in some cases. For convenience, this support can be switched off in
  programs using `haskell-gi` generated bindings, which do not require overloading
  support, by making them depend (in the `build-depends` field of the cabal file)
  on `haskell-gi-overloading == 0.0.*`.'
