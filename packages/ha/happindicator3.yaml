description: ! '# happindicator3


  This project is a fork of the original `happindicator` library which provided

  bindings to Ubuntu''s AppIndicator library.


  `happindicator3` uses a simplified build system and is compatible with the

  `gtk3` library, as opposed to `happindicator` which required the older `gtk`

  library.


  While not 100% identical to `happindicator`, the `happindicator3` API has stayed

  largely backwards compatible with the original `happindicator`.


  ## Build Notes


  This package requires `appindicator3-0.1` and its development files to be

  installed.


  The included demo application can be built by passing the "demo" flag to Cabal.


  ## Documentation


  Please refer to the API docs available on Hackage.


  ## Example


  A simple demo application can be found at `demo/Main.hs`.
