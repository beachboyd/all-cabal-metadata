  This package is provides the Happlets API that is common to all Happlet

  back-end provider libraries. Along with this package, it is necessary to

  install a back-end library such as ''happlets-lib-gtk''.  Currently Gtk+

  version 2 with a Cairo-based canvas is the only back-end available. Gtk+

  version 3, Xlib, SDL2, GLUT, and (possibly) Wayland back-ends are all

  feasible and may be implemented in the future.


  The goal of the Happlets project is to allow you to create very simple,

  thread-safe applications that contain nothing more than a single window

  with a drawing canvas that can respond to user input events, like mouse

  clicks, key-presses, or frame animation events. The intention is to

  create a minimal programming platform for small, single-purpose

  graphical applications which simply displays some interactive graphic,

  for example a plot of some data, or a simple game. Naturally, the

  Happlet program can be arbitrarily complex, but it may be better to

  consider other, FRP-based solutions if managing events becomes too

  difficult.


  A happlet back-end provider may provide additional widget API functions,

  but using these APIs will result in your applet being dependent on the

  specific back-end and will thus not be as portable as programming for

  the "happlets" package alone. Happlets aims to achieve a balance between

  being as minimal as possible, but still provide enough graphics drawing

  primitives to be useful for the widest range of possible applications.


  The Gtk+ v2 back-end provider can be downloaded from this link:
