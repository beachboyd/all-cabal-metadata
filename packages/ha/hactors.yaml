  About

  =====


  This library is about to implement the actor model on top of the GHC''s

  concurrency. Actors works as VM''s lightweight threads and messages works with

  STM''s channels.


  Usage

  =====


  The *Control.Concurrent.Actor* module provides the API that mimics Erlang''s

  concurrency primitives. See the haddocks for more details.


  Issues

  ======


  * Implement the *flush* funtion (to show already received messages)?


  * Write more examples.
