synopsis: Client support for POP3, SMTP, and IMAP
changelog: ! "0.5.1 (2016-05-05)\n------------------\n\n - SMTP: Strip carriage returns
  from the on lines before sending\n\n0.5 (2015-11-5)\n---------------\n\n - No longer
  render Bcc field when rendering messages (thanks Dan Aloni\n   <alonid@gmail.com>)\n
  - Implemented IDLE command (thanks Alexander Inyukhin\n   <shurick@sectorb.msk.ru>)\n
  - Added stream wait function (bsWaitForInput field of type BSStream)\n   (thanks
  Alexander Inyukhin <shurick@sectorb.msk.ru>)\n - SMTP: RCPT also includes Cc and
  Bcc lists rather than just To list\n   (thanks Author: Dan Aloni <alonid@gmail.com>)\n\n0.4.4
  -> 0.4.5 (2015-06-18)\n---------------------------\n\n - IMAP: select command must
  quote the mailbox name\n   (see https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/35)\n\n0.4.3
  -> 0.4.4 (2015-04-11)\n---------------------------\n\n - Fix a bug in IMAP Parser
  for listing Mboxes\n   (see https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/34)\n
  - Protocols modules re-exports AuthType\n   (see https://github.com/dpwright/HaskellNet-SSL/issues/10)\n\n0.4.2
  -> 0.4.3 (2015-04-06)\n---------------------------\n\n - Parser for IMAP LIST to
  return mailbox names unquoted\n   (see https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/34)\n
  - Update to build with GHC 7.10.1\n\n0.4.1 -> 0.4.2\n--------------\n\n - Add sendMimeMail'
  to send mime mails with in-memory attachments\n\n0.4 -> 0.4.1\n------------\n\n
  - login function for IMAP must escape the password\n   Due to the possibility of
  the password contain special characters\n   (See https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/31)\n
  - Improved documentation for SMTP\n - Merge pull request #29 from lemol/master:\n
  \  Update on SMTP example\n - Merge pull request #26 from lemol/master:\n   * Fix
  a bug when parsing the response of fetch in IMAP\n     (See https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/27)\n
  \  * Add a function for sending plain text email\n - Merge pull request #25 from
  lemol/master:\n   Add a function for authentication in SMTP\n - Merge pull request
  #24 from lemol/master:\n   Bug fix on PLAIN authentication encode\n\n0.3 -> 0.4\n----------\n\n
  - Merge pull request #22 from dpwright/parse-fix:\n   Fix parser error when passing
  parameters to FETCH\n   (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26183675/error-when-fetching-subject-from-email-using-haskellnets-imap)\n
  - Merge pull request #20 from vincenthz/master:\n   Replace Crypto by the much faster
  cryptohash\n - Merge pull request #19 from fegu/patch-1\n   remove closeSMTP at
  end of sendMimeMail\n   (sendMail and sendMimeMail should have the same behaviour
  towards the\n   connection given to the function. In addition, Office365 causes
  the\n   closeSMTP of sendMimeMail to raise an exception of already closed. Thus,\n
  \  removed.)\n - Merge pull request #18 from michaelbeaumont/issue17\n   Stopped
  the POP3 module from removing whitespace before response lines\n   except for the
  initial line with the POP3 status. Retrieved messages can now\n   be correctly parsed.\n
  - Merge pull request #16 from fegu/master\n   Fix store command to enable Office365
  support (Adding a space between UID\n   and flags in STORE command. This should
  have been there all the time, but\n   while some IMAP servers (notably Gmail) accepts
  that it is missing, others\n   (notably Office365) requires it.)\n - Merge pull
  request #10 from ppetr/master\n   Improve `tryCommand` so that it includes the failed
  server response.\n - Improve a bad piece of code in `sendMail`.\n   It used pattern
  matching and then catching the exception using `handle`,\n   which is very non-idiomatic
  and error prone. Also the code seemed to catch\n   the failure only to rethrow it.\n
  - Merge pull request #8 from ppetr/master\n   Upgrade to mime-mail >= 0.4.\n - Merge
  pull request #5 from sordina/master\n   Adding show constraint to show6 in Network/HaskellNet/IMAP.hs
  for\n   compatibility with GHC 7.4.1\n - Merge pull request #4 from nh2/ghc-7.2\n
  \  Fix compilation with GHC 7.0 and 7.2 (fixes Char and List imports)\n\n0.2.5 ->
  0.3\n------------\n\nPackage changes:\n * Constrained dependency on mime-mail to
  avoid API-breaking changes\n   in 0.4\n * Removed unused dependencies on parsec,
  time, containers, and\n   old-locale\n * Removed unused modules:\n   - Data.Record\n
  \  - Text.URI\n   - Text.MIME\n   - Atom test module\n   - Moved stream debugging
  module from test/ to\n     Network.HaskellNet.Debug\n * Moved modules into src/\n\nOther
  changes:\n * Got rid of stale module portability / maintainer / stability\n   annotations
  in source; moved copyright annotation into Cabal file\n * Removed some stale compiler
  pragmas\n * Resolved compiler warnings in all modules\n * Moved to using <$> more\n
  * Removed a lot of stale commented-out code\n * Shortened a lot of long lines\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Split up IMAP module into\n   Network.HaskellNet.IMAP (core functionality)\n
  \  Network.HaskellNet.Types (data types)\n   Network.HaskellNet.Connection (IMAP
  connection functions)\n * Moved Text.IMAPParsers to Network.HaskellNet.Parsers\n
  * Renamed IMAP 'Mailbox' type to 'MailboxName'\n * Split up POP3 module into\n   Network.HaskellNet.POP3
  (core functionality)\n   Network.HaskellNet.Types (data types)\n   Network.HaskellNet.Connection
  (POP connection functions)\n * IMAP.Parsers:\n   - removed unused Either handling
  functions\n   - constraind exports (originally exported everything)commit 682edece1bf5fb5923ea5bd04309819c630ff33d\n"

description: ! "HaskellNet\n==========\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lemol/HaskellNet.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lemol/HaskellNet)\n\nThis
  package provides client support for the E-mail protocols POP3,\nSMTP, and IMAP.\n\nSome
  examples of how to use the library are contained in the example/\ndirectory.  You
  should be able to run them by adjusting the file for\nyour mail server settings
  and then loading the file in ghci and type\n'main'. eg.\n\n  ghci -hide-package
  monads-fd example/smtpMimeMail.hs\n  main\n\nIf you encounter problems and want
  to debug the ghci\ndebugger works well:\n\n  :set -fbreak-on-exception\n  :trace
  main\n"
