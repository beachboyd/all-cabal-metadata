description: ! "This is not a cricket game. Hricket is a scoring application that
  will save you from having to draw up a Cricket \nscorecard if you don't have a chalkboard,
  or just don't feel like getting chalk on your hands. ;)\n\nIt supports two players,
  and will likely never support more. The bullseye is represented as the number '25'.
  This was \ndone to avoid unnecessary complexity, and might change in future versions,
  but for now, the bullseye is 25. When you hit \na bullseye, you enter 25, and not
  bullseye or b. If you try to enter those, it will tell it that it's invalid and
  have \nyou try again.\n\nThe recommended way to use this application, is to begin
  by opening it up and entering the names of both players. You'll \nthen want player
  1 to throw 3 darts. Enter each dart into the application one at a time. You'll type
  the number you hit \non the board, a single space, and the number of markings. For
  instance, if you hit the number 16 in the treble, you \nwould enter '16 3'. If you
  hit 20 in the single you would enter '20 1'. For numbers lower than 15, which are
  not used in \nstandard Cricket games, enter 0. If didn't hit any relevant numbers,
  you can type 'skip' (or 's' since 0.5) to skip the rest of your turn. You can also
  do this even if you got one relevant number. When all numbers are opened/closed
  by one of the players, that player's score will be ran against the \nother players
  score, and if it's higher, that player will be declared the winner. Otherwise, the
  other player wins.\n\nYou are expected to know how to play Cricket before using
  this application. This is not a Cricket tutorial, and the \napplication will not
  teach you to play Cricket.\n\nI might wrap a simple GUI around this application
  in the future.\n\nI made this application our of necessity and boredom. Enjoy."
