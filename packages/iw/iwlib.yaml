description: ! "![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/iwlib.svg)\n\n# About\n\n*iwlib*
  is a thin wrapper over the *iw* C library, providing access to\nwireless card information
  in supported systems.\n\n# Bug Reports\n\nTo submit bug reports you can use the
  [bug tracker over at Github].\n\n[bug tracker over at Github]: https://github.com/jaor/iwlib/issues\n\n#
  Installation\n\n## Using cabal-install\n\nXmobar is available from [Hackage], and
  you can install it using\n`cabal-install`:\n\n        cabal install iwlib\n\n##
  From source\n\nIf you don't have `cabal-install` installed, you can get xmobar's\nsource
  code in a variety of ways:\n\n  - From [Hackage]. Just download the latest release
  from xmobar's\n    hackage page.\n  - From [Github]. You can also obtain a tarball
  in [Github's\n    downloads page]. You'll find there links to each tagged release.\n
  \ - From the bleeding edge repo. If you prefer to live dangerously,\n    just get
  the latest and greatest (and buggiest, I guess) using\n    git:\n\n        git clone
  git://github.com/jaor/iwlib\n\n\n[Github's downloads page]: https://github.com/jaor/iwlib/downloads\n\nIf
  you have cabal installed, you can now use it from within its source\ntree:\n\n        cabal
  install\n\n\nOtherwise, run the configure script:\n\n        runhaskell Setup.lhs
  configure\n\nNow you can build the source:\n\n        runhaskell Setup.lhs build\n
  \       runhaskell Setup.lhs install # possibly to be run as root\n\n# External
  dependencies\n\nNo other Haskell library is required, but you will need the [iwlib]
  C\nlibrary and headers in your system (e.g., install `libiw-dev` in\nDebian-based
  systems or `wireless_tools` on Arch Linux).\n\n# Authors\n\nThis library is written
  and maintaned by Jose Antonio Ortega Ruiz.\n\n# Thanks\n\nMany thanks to Leif Warner
  for suggesting the creation of this library\nand providing the initial hackage scaffolding.\n\n#
