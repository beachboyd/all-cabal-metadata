description: ! "* asset-bundle\n  This library aims to solve the problem of bundling
  a Haskell executable with\n  its [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-data-files][assets]]
  *and* those in its dependencies by providing a couple of functions\n  you can call
  from your project's ~Setup.hs~ so that doing `{cabal, stack}\n  build` also creates
  a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)][zip]] of the executable and
  all of the assets it needs\n  along with a launch script (a batch file on Windows
  and a shell script\n  otherwise) that runs the executable adjusting various environment
  variables so\n  that it can find them at runtime. Even if you're not deploying an
  executable\n  directly to your users this package still makes it considerably simpler
  to\n  dry-run on a test machine or in a Docker container.\n\n* Documentation\n  This
  library is extensively documented on [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/asset-bundle/docs/Distribution-Simple-AssetBundle.html][Hackage]],
  including [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/asset-bundle/docs/Distribution-Simple-AssetBundle.html#g:1][further
  motivation]]\n  for this library and a [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/asset-bundle/docs/Distribution-Simple-AssetBundle.html#g:3][Quick
  Start Guide]].\n"
