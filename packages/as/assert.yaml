description: ! 'GHC supports compile-time toggling of run-time assertions via the

  @-fignore-asserts@ flag, which only effects a behavioural change in

  ''Control.Exception.assert''. Furthermore the reported location only gives

  the use site of the aforementioned, making it difficult to abstract over

  and hence cumbersome to use.


  This package aims to make assertions more convenient, and also provides

  a rule to rewrite assertions to ''id'' when @-fignore-asserts@ is used.'
