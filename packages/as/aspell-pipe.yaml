synopsis: Pipe-based interface to the Aspell program
changelog: |2

  0.4
  ---

  Misc changes:
   * The package now uses and depends on `async` instead of using raw
     `forkIO`.

  0.3
  ---

  Package changes:
   * Relaxed process lower bound to version 1.3.

  API changes:
   * Added 'aspellDictionaries' to obtain the list of installed
     dictionaries.

  Other changes:
   * startAspell now gracefully handles Aspell startup failures by
     reporting Aspell's standard error output in the event of a failed
     startup. It also sanity-checks the Aspell pipe mode identification
     string. (Fixes #2, #3.)


  0.2
  ---

  * Relaxed base upper bound to < 5.

  aspell-pipe
  -----------

  This package provides a simple interface to the `aspell` spell checker
  tool. In particular, this library communicates with `aspell` using
  its pipe interface rather than linking directly to the Aspell shared
  library. This is because in some cases it is desirable to avoid a shared
  library dependency and to deal gracefully with an absent spell checker.

  To get started, see the Haddock documentation for `Text.Aspell`.
