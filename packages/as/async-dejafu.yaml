description: ! 'The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async async> library

  provides a higher-level interface over threads, allowing users to

  conveniently run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their

  results. This package is a reimplementation of async using the

  @MonadConc@ abstraction from

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/concurrency concurrency>, providing

  easy-to-use asynchronous operaitons within an easily-testable

  framework.


  This library itself is tested with

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dejafu dejafu>.


  When these functions are used in an IO context, the behaviour should

  appear identical to the original async package.'
