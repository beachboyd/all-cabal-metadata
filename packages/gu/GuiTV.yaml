description: ! "GuiTV is a small library for GUI-style visualizing functional values.
  \ It\ncan also be viewed as an approach to functional GUIs.  It is implemented\nvery
  simply by using Phooey (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/phooey) in the\nTV framework
  (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV).  For a fuller\ndescription and link to documentation,
  please see the project wiki page:\n\n  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GuiTV\n\nYou
  can configure, build, generate haddock docs, and install all in the\nusual way with
  Cabal commands.\n\n  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure\n  runhaskell Setup.lhs build\n
  \ runhaskell Setup.lhs install\n\nSee src/Examples.hs for examples.\n"
