description: ! "geodetics\n=========\n\nHaskell library of data types and calculations
  for positions on planet Earth\n\nThis library provides \"geodetic\" positions. That
  is, latitude, longitude and altitude on a \nspecified Terrestrial Reference Frame
  (TRF). The basic TRF is the WGS84, which is the\none used by GPS and Google Earth.
  Others can be added by describing the underlying ellipsoid\nand the difference in
  angle and centre with WGS84, and a position in one TRF can be\ntransformed into
  another. Given two points in the same TRF you can find the shortest distance \nbetween
  them and the bearing from one to the other.\n\nOnce you have a geodetic position
  defined you can project it onto a flat plane, or Grid.\nAt present Transverse Mercator
  and Oblique Stereographic grids are provided. More can be\nadded by defining new
  instances of the Grid typeclass: see \"AddingProjections.txt\" for\ndetais.\n\nThe
  Paths module defines a path as a parametric function of distance that returns a\nposition
  and a bearing. Given two paths you can find their intersection using a fast\niterative
  algorithm.\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\nVersion 0.0.2: Tided up cabal file
  and removed spurious dependency on Parsec.\n\nVersion 0.0.3: Updated for Haskell
  Platform 2014.2.0.0 and GHC 7.8.3. Fixed\n   some minor documentation issues.\n\nVersion
  0.0.4: Updated for Dimensional 1.0.\n"
