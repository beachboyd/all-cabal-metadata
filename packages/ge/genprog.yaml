description: ! 'This package provides a /genetic programming/ framework. Genetic

  programming is an evolutionary technique, inspired by biological

  evolution, to evolve programs for solving specific problems. A genetic

  program is represented by a value of an algebraic datatype and

  associated with a custom-defined /fitness/ value indicating the quality

  of the solution. Starting from a randomly generated initial population

  of genetic programs, the genetic operators of /selection/, /crossover/,

  and /mutation/ are used to evolve programs of increasingly better

  quality.'
