description: Here we port the gdiff algorithm and library to work over the generics-mrsop,
  enabling code that relies on the later library to access the gdiff algorithm. Moreover,
  we also bring in the utilities for converting a gdiff patch into a more structured
  version, facilitating merging. For some literature on the topic check Arian's MSc
  thesis at <https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/380853> or our TyDe 2017 paper
  at <https://victorcmiraldo.github.io/data/tyde2017.pdf>.
