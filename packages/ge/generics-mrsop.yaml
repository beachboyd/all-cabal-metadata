synopsis: Generic Programming with Mutually Recursive Sums of Products.
changelog: "# Revision history for generics-mrsop\n\n## 2.1.0 -- Jul 2019\n\n- Added
  datatype `Holes` for representing families annotated with holes.\n- Brought in some
  monadic attribute grammar combinators\n- Big documentation update on a number of
  places\n\n## 2.0.0 -- Mar 2019\n\n- `Eq1` and `Show1` are now called `EqHO` and
  `ShowHO`. This avoids clashing with the\nalready existing `Eq1` in `Prelude`. \n-
  A number of functions received a `IsNat` constraint.\n- `Generics.MRSOP.Util` is
  now re-exported by `Generics.MRSOP.Base`.\n- Support for inheritted attributes no
  longer exists in `Generics.MRSOP.AG`\n- `Fix` is no longer implemented by `AnnFix`.
  The later now lives in `Generics.MRSOP.AG`\n\n## 1.2.2 -- Sep 2018\n\n- added monadic
  catamorphism for NP\n- added pattern signature generation for TH\n- require `TestEqualiy`
  for opaque types singleton\n- Zippers over deep representations\n- Refined `Metadata`
  handling\n- `Fix` is implemented as `AnnFix`\n\n## 1.0.0.0  -- May 2018\n\n- First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n"

  # generics-mrsop

  Generic Programming, with combinators, for Mutually Recursive Families in the
  Sums of Products style.

  Check the `Generics.MRSOP.Examples.RoseTreeTH` for a simple quick start,
  or read our [paper](https://icfp18.sigplan.org/event/tyde-2018-sums-of-products-for-mutually-recursive-datatypes), "Sums of Products for Mutually Recursive Datatypes", for a more detailed description.
