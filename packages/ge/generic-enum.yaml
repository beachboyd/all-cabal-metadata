description: ! 'The default Enum class has a couple of issues that limit it''s flexibility
  namely:


  1) The \"Enum\" type must be always \"Int\", even when this loses information, such
  as in

  the case of \"Integer\" (due to overflow) and \"Rational\" (in the case of fractions).


  2) "enumFromTo" etc like functions can only produce lists, instead of directly producing
  other

  list like data types. Aside from effeciency, using a list as an intermediary can
  lose information also.


  The Enum class this package defines should be largely a drop in replacement for
  Prelude''s Enum,

  with some minor exceptions detailed in the documentation.'
