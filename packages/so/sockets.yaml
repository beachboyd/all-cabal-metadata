description: |-
  This library provides a high-level abstraction for network sockets. It uses
  Haskell2010 (along with GADTs) without typeclasses to ensure that
  consumers of the API can only call appropriate functions on a socket.
  Exceptions are tracked in the types of functions and returned to the caller
  with `Either`. The caller is free to handle these gracefully or to throw
  them. This library only throws exceptions when it detects that it has misused
  the operating system's sockets API (open an issue for this) or when the
  caller asks for a negatively-sized slice of a buffer (such exceptions are
  unrecoverable and indicate a mistake in the code consuming this API).
