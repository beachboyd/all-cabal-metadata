  Copyright &copy; 2008-2014 Bart Massey


  This program is a simple command-line audio delay line for

  WAVE format audio files.  There is precious little

  documentation at this point; that needs to be fixed soon.

  However, I think it''s a nice demo app for my

  [WAVE](http://github.com/BartMassey/WAVE) library.
