description: ! 'Basically a broad extension to the ''IArray'' interface for all sorts
  of key/value maps.


  Arrays, maps etc can all use these classes so datatypes can be swapped in and out
  of algorithms.


  The classes have plenty of functions, but also many default implementations, so
  making instances for your datatypes should be relatively easy.


  Of course, if you give specialised defintions you might get better performance for
  some operations.


  Currently only deals with pure structures but mutable structures are next on the
  todo list.'
