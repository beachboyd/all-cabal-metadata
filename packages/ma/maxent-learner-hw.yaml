description: ! 'Provides an implementation of Hayes and Wilson''s machine learning
  algorithm for maxent phonotactic grammars, as both a command-line tool and a function
  library.  The learner takes in a lexicon and produces a list of weighted constraints
  penalizing certain sound sequemces in an attempt to produce a probability distribution
  of words which maximizes the probability of the lexicon. Once such a set of constraints
  is generated, it can be tested by using it to generate random pronounceable text.


  This package is an implementation of the algorithm described in Hayes and Wilson''s
  paper /A Maximum Entropy Model of Phonotactics and Phonotactic Learning/ (available
  at <http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/Phonotactics/Index.htm>).'
