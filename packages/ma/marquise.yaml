description: ! 'Marquise is a collection of a library and two executables for use
  with Vaultaire.


  1. A client and server library for reading/writing to the vault and spool files.

  This provides streaming reads and writes to the vault using

  [pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) as well as writing to spool

  files with automatic caching and rotation.


  2. An executable `marquised`, a daemon which writes data to the vault from spool

  files generated from users of the marquise library.


  3. An executable `data`, used for easily inspecting data in the vault as well as

  marquise cache files.'
