synopsis: ! 'A program for creating and managing a static

  weblog with LaTeX math and diagrams'
changelog: ! "0.6\n---\n\n * Added support for building with GHC 7.10\n * doc: update
  manual-generating scripts to assume \"mb\" is installed a\n   cabal sandbox\n *
  Propagate Pandoc loading errors to top level via EitherT\n * Fix read-then-close
  (lazy IO) (thanks Thomas M. DuBuisson\n   (thomas.dubuisson@gmail.com))\n * Un-bitrot
  (wrt system-filepath and old-locale/pandoc) (thanks Thomas\n   M. DuBuisson (thomas.dubuisson@gmail.com))\n
  * Update to use Pandoc 1.12, JuicyPixels 3.1\n * Render images at double DPI, then
  shrink in the HTML (read: support\n   retina displays!)\n * Stop using greadlink
  in manual scripts\n * Move Mathjax configuration from Haskell code to page template
  (fixes #11)\n * Add browser reloading support to blog regeneration\n * Add built-in
  HTTP server in listen mode\n * manual: actually run \"mb\" to generate \"mb\" output
  in the manual\n * Discontinue support for Gnuplot\n * Start to use fsnotify\n *
  Added manual\n * mathjax: include cancel extension\n * bugfix: use correct indexing
  when generating next/prev post links\n * Remove support for gladtex\n * bugfix:
  only consider .html files when checking for modified templates\n * Feature: parse
  date from blog post header and include in RSS feed\n * Feature: add support for
  page-wide TeX macro blocks (#tex-macros) for\n   both Mathjax and TikZ\n * Add more
  packages to TikZ preamble, enable AMS extensions in mathjax\n * Mathjax: turn on
  AMS equation numbering, also print tikz source on\n   tikz failure\n * tikz: add
  calc tikzlibrary\n * Rename -h/--html-dir to -o/--output-dir, add -h/--help and
  -v/--version\n * CHANGE: rename MB_BASE_DIR to MB_DATA_DIR, --baseDir to --data-dir;\n
  \  also remove default output directory behavior\n * Fixed typos in the documentation
  (thanks Peter Simons\n   (peter.1.simons@nokia.com))\n"

description: ! "mathblog\n========\n\nmathblog is a Haskell program targeted at people
  who want to write\nstatically-generated, mathematically-themed weblogs.  It supports:\n\n
  - Extended Markdown input syntax as supported by the Pandoc library\n\n - Inline
  and block-level TeX math rendered by MathJax or LaTeX\n\n - Function graphing with
  TikZ / pgfplots LaTeX packages\n\n - Integration of Javascript-based web services
  such as Disqus\n\n - Template-based document rendering with support for layout and
  style\n   customization\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\nSee the manual PDF
  in doc/.\n\nProject vision\n==============\n\nI wrote mathblog with a very specific
  set of requirements in mind,\nmotivated by the following principles:\n\n - A blog
  should be easy to create, host, and update.\n\n - A blog should be easy to maintain.\n\n
  - I should be able to edit posts in my editor of choice and write\n   them in an
  intelligent textual markup language.\n\n - It should be easy to embed high-quality
  mathematical symbols and\n   equations in the blog posts.\n\nAs a result, mathblog
  has the following properties:\n\n - The software is composed of a single executable
  which will\n   automatically take care of creating your blog and regenerating\n
  \  pages when your post markup changes.\n\n - All content is stored in plain text
  files and is generated\n   statically.  No database or web framework is used.\n\n
  - A mathblog can be hosted with a simple static fileserver such as\n   thttpd, Lighttpd,
  or Apache.\n\n - Blog posts are written in the Markdown format with extensions,
  as\n   supported by the Pandoc document converter.\n\n - Math is embedded with `$...$`
  or `\\(...\\)` for inline math and\n   `$$...$$` or `\\[...\\]` for block-level
  math.\n\nThese properties have some nice advantages; your blog content is\ncacheable
  and can be subjected to revision control.  Posts are easy to\nedit and editing doesn't
  require a web browser.  The static file\nrepresentation model means you can compose
  a blog post on your laptop\nand get it just right using a local installation of
  mathblog, then\npush it up to your server to post it to your public blog.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nmathblog
  takes advantage of three primary software components:\n\n - Pandoc, a document-processing
  library.\n\n - Math typesetting packages:\n\n   - MathJax if you choose `mathjax`
  for the value of the\n     `mathBackend` configuration setting.  mathblog uses the
  MathJax\n     CDN for MathJax resources.\n\n - Function graph plotting packages:\n\n
  \  - The TikZ and pgfplots LaTeX packages if you set `tikz = yes` in\n     your
  config.  This is the recommended backend for function graph\n     plotting.\n"
