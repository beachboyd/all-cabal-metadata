  from http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7

  "The Majordomo Protocol (MDP) defines a reliable service-oriented

  request-reply dialog between a set of client applications, a broker

  and a set of worker applications. MDP covers presence, heartbeating,

  and service-oriented request-reply processing. It originated from the

  Majordomo pattern defined in Chapter 4 of the Guide."


  This is an implementation for Haskell.

  Examples of use can be found in echo_worker.hs and mdp_client.hs

  (which doubles as a helpful command line tool for issuing MDP commands)
