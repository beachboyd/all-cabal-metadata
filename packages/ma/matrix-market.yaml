description: ! 'The Matrix Market (MM) exchange formats provide a simple mechanism

  to facilitate the exchange of matrix data. In particular, the

  objective has been to define a minimal base ASCII file format which

  can be very easily explained and parsed, but can easily adapted to

  applications with a more rigid structure, or extended to related

  data objects. The MM exchange format for matrices is really a

  collection of affiliated formats which share design elements. In the

  initial specification, two matrix formats are defined.


  Coordinate Format - A file format suitable for representing general

  sparse matrices. Only nonzero entries are provided, and the coordinates

  of each nonzero entry is given explicitly.


  Array Format - A file format suitable for representing general dense

  matrices. All entries are provided in a pre-defined (column-oriented)

  order.
