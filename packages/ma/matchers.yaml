description: ! '# matchers


  This package contains helpers for performing text matches using

  regular expressions as well as simpler matching that sees if a

  particular substring exists within a larger string.


  It was written mostly for use with

  [Penny](http://www.github.com/massysett/penny) so it doesn''t have much

  of a stable API.


  It uses the pcre C library, so make sure you have that installed.
