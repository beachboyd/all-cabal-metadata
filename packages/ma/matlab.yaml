description: ! 'This package aims to provide a comprehensive interface to the

  MathWorks MATLAB(R) libraries and native data structures, including

  complete matrix access, MAT-format files, linking and execution of

  runtime libraries and engine.  Requires MATLAB for full functionality

  or an installed Matlab Component Runtime (MCR). This has been tested

  with MATLAB R2014a and might work with others.


  [/Installation/]

  You will probably need add some arguments that point Cabal to your MATLAB

  installation. For example, on a Linux system, it may look like this:


  > cabal install --extra-lib-dirs="/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014a/bin/glnxa64/" --extra-include-dirs="/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014a/extern/include/"'
