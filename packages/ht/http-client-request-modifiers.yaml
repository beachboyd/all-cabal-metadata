description: ! 'This package contains simple, monadic functions that modify an HTTP
  `Request`

  from `http-client`. They make it easy to chain request updates and allow for

  arbitrary monadic effects.


  There are certainly useful functions that are currently not provided. Please

  create an issue or a pull request if you have suggestions.
