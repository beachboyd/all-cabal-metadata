  haskell src. This allows\n    proper treatment of TH single quotes (fix for #26)\n

  \ - added timing information to the output\n  - possibility to list all tests\n
  \ - several bugfixes, especially related to location information in presence\n    of
  an extra cpp invocation\n  - HTF itself now has a test suite\n  - removed upper
  bounds from .cabal files\n  - backwards incompatibilities:\n    + Test.Framework
  now longer exports all of Test.Framework.TestManager and\n      Test.Framework.BlackBoxTest.
  For modules that only define tests, no changes\n      should be necessary. However,
  you likely need to adjust your test runner\n      module by importing Test.Framework.TestManager
  and possibly Test.Framework.BlackBoxTest.\n    + Some reorganization in Test.Framework.TestManager
  and related modules, introduction\n      of Test.Framework.TestTypes. Usually, your
  code should not be affected\n      by these changes.\n\n* 0.9.0.0 (2012-09-26)\n
  \ NOTE: this version is NOT backwards compatible with 0.8.*. The documentation on\n
  \ hackage describes what you need to do in order to upgrade.\n\n  - Totally reworked
  how tests are collected\n  - Greatly improved documentation (fixes issue #2)\n  -
  Added assertThrowsIO and similar functions (fixes issue #6)\n  - Added htfMain function\n\n*
  0.8.2.0 (2012-01-30)\n  - Assertions can be run via runTest\n  - Support for assertNotEqual\n
  \ - Bugfixes\n\n* 0.8.1.1 (2011-11-07)\n  - Bugfixes\n\n* 0.8.1.0 (2011-11-07)\n
  \ - fixed build dependencies to include process 1.1.*\n\n* 0.8.1.0 (2011-10-01)\n
  \ - multi-line diff with pretty-printing\n  - bugfixes\n  - build support for GHC
  7.2.1\n\n* 0.8.0.0 (2011-09-20)\n  - support for `--quiet' option to report failures
  only\n  - color support\n  - diff support: if an equality assertions fails, HTF
  shows a diff of\n    the expected and the given value\n  - more uniform output\n
  \ - tests to execute are now given by a regular expression,\n    tests to ignored
  are prefixed with `--not'\n\n* 0.7.1.0 (2011-07-08)\n  - support for pending tests
  and quick check properties\n  - support for ignoring certain tests in the argument
  list of\n    Test.Framework.TestManager.runTestWithArgs (simply prefix the\n    test
  names with a '-')\n\n* 0.7.0.1 (2011-05-21)\n  - minor fix for the tutorial (thanks
  to Marnix)\n\n* 0.7.0.0 (2011-01-25)\n  - htfpp parses extension from pragmas\n
  \ - runTest, runTestWithArgs, runTestWithFilter return an appropriate exit\n    code\n\n*
  0.6.0.1 (2010-12-05)\n  - support for GHC 7, QuickCheck 2.3, containers 0.4 and
  directory 1.1\n    (thanks to David Leuschner)\n\n* 0.6.0.0 (2010-11-12)\n  - generalized
  mtl dependency to accept version 1.1* and 2.0.*.\n\n* 0.5.0.1 (2010-10-11)\n  -
  preprocessor now parses bang patterns\n\n* 0.5.0.0 (2010-10-05)\n  - added `--hunit'
  flag to htfpp. (The `--hunit' flag causes assert-like\n    macros to be expanded
  in a way that is backwards-compatible with the\n    corresponding functions of the
  HUnit library.)\n  - Some functions in Test.Framework.HUnitWrapper were renamed
  in a\n    non-backwards compatible way. The assert*P functions are now called\n
  \   assert*Pretty, and the function assertSetEqual is now called\n    assertListsEqualAsSet\n\n*
  0.4.0.0 (2010-09-02)\n  - More specific version constraints in .cabal file\n\n*
  0.3.5.0 (2010-08-30)\n  - Testable instance for lists\n\n* 0.3.4.0 (2010-08-30)\n
  \ - htfpp now accepts code subject to preprocessing with cpp\n"

description: ! "# HTF - The Haskell Test Framework\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skogsbaer/HTF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skogsbaer/HTF)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/HTF.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HTF)\n\n*

  Summary\n\nThe Haskell Test Framework (HTF for short) lets you define unit tests\n(http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit),
  QuickCheck properties\n(https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck), and black
  box tests in an\neasy and convenient way. HTF uses a custom preprocessor that collects\ntest
  definitions automatically. Furthermore, the preprocessor allows\nHTF to report failing
  test cases with exact file name and line number\ninformation. Additionally, HTF
  tries to produce highly readable output\nfor failing tests: for example, it colors
  and pretty prints expected and\nactual results and provides a diff between the two
  values.\n\nLook [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HTF/latest/doc/html/Test-Framework-Tutorial.html)\nfor
  a short tutorial on HTF. The following slightly out-dated\n[blog article](http://factisresearch.blogspot.de/2011/10/new-version-of-htf-with-diffs-colors.html)\ndemonstrates
  HTF's coloring, pretty-printing and diff functionality.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\n*
  Install from http://hackage.haskell.org/ using `cabal install HTF`\n* Install from
  source:\n\n        $ git clone git@github.com:skogsbaer/HTF.git\n        $ cd HTF\n
  \       $ cabal install\n\n## Getting started\n\n* Read the [tutorial](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HTF/latest/doc/html/Test-Framework-Tutorial.html).\n*
  Experiment with the sample project located in the `sample` directory of HTF's source
  tree.\n"
