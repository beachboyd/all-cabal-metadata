  ### 0.1.3.0

  * New functions `receiveUpgradeResponse`, 'receiveConnectResponse', and `unsafeWithRawStreams` for accessing full-duplex low-level streams (e.g. for upgrading to Websockets protocol
  * New function `makeConnection` for constructing a `Connection` object over custom streams.

  ### 0.1.2.0

  * New functions `unsafeReceiveResponse` and `unsafeReceiveResponseRaw` that do not automatically skip to end-of-stream

  ### 0.1.1.0

  * New alternative connection-setup API (`ConnectionAddress` et al.)
  * New function `getHeaderMap` for exporting all response headers at once
  * Add convenience functions `bytestringBody`, `lazyBytestringBody`, `utf8TextBody`, `utf8LazyTextBody`
  * Add support for Brotli HTTP compression

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
  * Derived from `http-streams-core-0.8.6.1` & `http-common-0.8.2.0`

description: |-
  An HTTP client, using the Snap Framework's [io-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams) library to
  handle the streaming IO. The @http-io-streams@ API designed for ease of use when querying web services and dealing with the result as streaming I/O.

  The library is exported in a single module; see "Network.Http.Client"
  for full documentation.

  __NOTE__: This is a fork of [http-streams](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams)
  with a lighter dependency footprint which focuses on core HTTP
  functionality and as a consequence doesn't include out-of-the-box
  support for handling JSON data. If you need support for handling JSON
  web-services, you should use the original @http-streams@ package instead of
  this package.
