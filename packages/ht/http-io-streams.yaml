description: ! 'An HTTP client, using the Snap Framework''s [io-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams)
  library to

  handle the streaming IO. The @http-io-streams@ API designed for ease of use when
  querying web services and dealing with the result as streaming I/O.


  The library is exported in a single module; see "Network.Http.Client"

  for full documentation.


  __NOTE__: This is a fork of [http-streams](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams)

  with a lighter dependency footprint which focuses on core HTTP

  functionality and as a consequence doesn''t include out-of-the-box

  support for handling JSON data. If you need support for handling JSON

  web-services, you should use the original @http-streams@ package instead of

  this package.'
