description: ! 'A low-level HTTP library that can be used to build more

  sophisticated applications on top of it.


  The design goals are:


  [secure] To mitigate denial-of-service attacks, everything is

  bounded.


  [efficient] Message bodies are read in chunks, so that they

  can be processed in constant space.


  [universal] No framework for streaming @IO@ is used.  This

  allows you to build on top of it, using the libraries that

  fit your purpose.'
