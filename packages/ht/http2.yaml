synopsis: HTTP/2 library including frames, priority queues and HPACK
changelog: |
  ## 1.6.3

  * Fixing two bugs of HPACK pointed out by h2spec v2.

  ## 1.6.2

  * Improving the performance of HPACK.
  * Huffman encoding is now based on H2O's one.

  ## 1.6.1

  * Improving the performance of HPACK.

  ## 1.6.0

  * Reverse indices of HPACK are now based on tokens.
  * New APIs: encodeTokenHeader and decodeTokenHeader.
  * Deleted API: encodeHeaderBuffer -- use encodeTokenHeader instead.
  * New module: Network.HPACK.Token

  ## 1.5.4

  * Fixing a bug due to misuse of memcpy(). (#8)

  ## 1.5.3

  * Adding debug information.

  ## 1.5.2

  * Minor optimization for HPACK.

  ## 1.5.1

  * Adding a missing file for testing.

  ## 1.5.0

  * New API for HPACK. HPACK is much faster than 1.4.x (roughly x3.2).
    The default encoding is now Linear instead of LinearH.

  ## 1.4.5

  * Removing zero reset from priority queues.

  ## 1.4.4

  * Fixing a bug of reverse index.

  ## 1.4.3

  * Priority benchmark is now external information versions.
  * Using proper baseDeficit for deletion.

  ## 1.4.2

  * Test files are now self-contained.

  ## 1.4.1

  * The reverse indices for static and dynamic are combined for performance.

  ## 1.4.0

  * Providing dequeueSTM, isEmpty and isEmptySTM. Users can compose
    their own control queue with dequeueSTM and isEmptySTM.

  * Removing enqueueControl: it appeared that PriorityTree is not
    suitable for control frames. ã€€For example, the dependency of all
    control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
    control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
    should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.

  ## 1.3.1

  * Defining IllegalTableSizeUpdate.

  ## 1.3.0

  * APIs `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed again. `Precedence` is introduced.

  ## 1.2.0

  * APIs of `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed. `delete` is provided. Internal data structure is changed from random skew heap to priority search queue.
