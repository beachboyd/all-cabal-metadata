description: ! '# http-grammar


  `http-grammar` is a Haskell package that provides Attoparsec-based

  productions that are faithful to the HTTP grammar specified in RFC-2616.


  The guiding philosophy of this package is to prioritize precision and

  faithfulness to RFC-2616 over all other considerations.


  Contributions are welcome and encouraged! The development plan for this

  package is to add productions from time to time as they are needed in

  my other work, and to solicit the contributions of productions from you

  as they are needed in your other work.


  I''m also willing to take requests. If there is a production you need but for

  whatever reason can''t or don''t want to implement, just submit a github issue.


  Thanks!
