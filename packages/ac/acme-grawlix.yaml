description: ! 'Readable code is a laudable goal, yet most Haskell code

  is littered with totally unpronounceable symbols of

  various sorts. How can code be readable if it''s

  unspeakable?

  This package is designed to improve upon this sad state

  of affairs by giving pronounceable aliases to various

  symbols of all sorts.
