description: ! 'This trivial package presents a simplified interface to

  the most excellent @ansi-terminal@ package, exposing only

  the functionallity that I personally use. It is very

  limited, but very easy to use.


  This package allows you to manipulate the text output

  terminal (assuming your program has one). Specifically,

  it supports colour changes and title changes (for

  virtual terminals). Impressively, it (or rather, the

  package it wraps) works on both Windows and Unix.

  Under Windows, it uses native Win32 calls, while under

  Unix it uses ANSI escape codes.'
