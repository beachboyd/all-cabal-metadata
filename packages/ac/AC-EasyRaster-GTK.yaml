description: ! 'This package is a thin layer over Gtk2hs providing an easy

  interface for people who want to do bitmapped graphics.


  Cairo already provides easy access to /vector/ graphics;

  this package is directed at /bitmap/ graphics (i.e.,

  reading and writing individual pixels). This is useful for

  applications such as fractal generators, ray tracers, etc.


  Changes:


  * Should work with Gtk2hs 0.11.x now.


  * Fix minor documentation glitches.'
