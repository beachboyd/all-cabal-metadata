description: ! 'This package is written in 100% Haskell and enables you to

  write PPM (\"Portable Pixel Map\") images in human-readable

  text format as well as the more efficient binary format.

  It uses the ByteString library for maximum efficiency.

  For those that don''t know, PPM is an image file format

  which is trivially simple, but therefore horribly inefficient.

  None the less, many programs can read PPM files, so this

  package represents an easy way to write Haskell code that

  generates images, without having to depend on any external

  C code.'
