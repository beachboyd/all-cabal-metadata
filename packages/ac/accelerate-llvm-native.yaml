  # Change Log

  Notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and the
  project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning
  Policy (PVP)](https://pvp.haskell.org)

  ## [1.2.0.1] - 2019-04-29

   * support for LLVM-7
   * support for LLVM-8

  ### Contributors

  Special thanks to those who contributed patches as part of this release:

   * Trevor L. McDonell (@tmcdonell)
   * Viktor Kronvall (@considerate)

  ## [1.2.0.0] - 2018-04-03

  ## [1.1.0.1] - 2017-10-04
  ### Fixed
   * fix for `runQ*` generating multiple declarations with the same name


  ## [1.1.0.0] - 2017-09-21
  ### Added
   * support for GHC-8.2
   * caching of compilation results ([accelerate-llvm#17])
   * new runtime linker; this fixes the annoying "forkOS_entry: interrupted" error. Note that currently this only supports x86_64 macOS and linux
   * support for ahead-of-time compilation (`runQ` and `runQAsync`)

  ### Changed
   * generalise `run1*` to polyvariadic `runN*`
   * programs run using all cores by default; the environment variable
     `ACCELERATE_LLVM_NATIVE_THREADS` is used to set the number of worker threads
     rather than `+RTS -N`


  ## [1.0.0.0] - 2017-03-31
   * initial release

  This package compiles Accelerate code to LLVM IR, and executes that code on
  multicore CPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs. This avoids the need to go through `nvcc`
  or `clang`. For details on Accelerate, refer to the [main repository][GitHub].

  We love all kinds of contributions, so feel free to open issues for missing
  features as well as report (or fix!) bugs on the [issue tracker][Issues].

  Dependencies
  ------------

  Haskell dependencies are available from Hackage, but there are several external
  library dependencies that you will need to install as well:

   * [`LLVM`](http://llvm.org)
   * [`libFFI`](http://sourceware.org/libffi/) (if using the `accelerate-llvm-native` backend for multicore CPUs)
   * [`CUDA`](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (if using the `accelerate-llvm-ptx` backend for NVIDIA GPUs)


  Docker
  ------

  A [docker](https://www.docker.com) container is provided with this package
  preinstalled (via stack) at `/opt/accelerate-llvm`. Note that if you wish to use
  the `accelerate-llvm-ptx` GPU backend, you will need to install the [NVIDIA
  docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) plugin; see that page for more
  information.

  ```sh
  $ docker run -it tmcdonell/accelerate-llvm
  ```


  Installing LLVM
  ---------------

  When installing LLVM, make sure that it includes the `libLLVM` shared library.
  If you want to use the GPU targeting `accelerate-llvm-ptx` backend, make sure
  you install (or build) LLVM with the 'nvptx' target.

  ## Homebrew

  Example using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on macOS:

  ```sh
  $ brew install llvm-hs/llvm/llvm-8
  ```

  ## Debian/Ubuntu

  For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distributions, the LLVM.org website provides
  binary distribution packages. Check [apt.llvm.org](http://apt.llvm.org) for
  instructions for adding the correct package database for your OS version, and
  then:

  ```sh
  $ apt-get install llvm-8-dev
  ```

  ## Building from source

  If your OS does not have an appropriate LLVM distribution available, you can also build from source. Detailed build instructions are available on the [LLVM.org website](http://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/docs/CMake.html). Note that you will require at least [CMake 3.4.3](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) and a recent C++ compiler; at least Clang 3.1, GCC 4.8, or Visual Studio 2015 (update 3).

    1. Download and unpack the [LLVM-8.0 source code](http://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/llvm-8.0.0.src.tar.xz). We'll refer to
       the path that the source tree was unpacked to as `LLVM_SRC`. Only the main
       LLVM source tree is required, but you can optionally add other components
       such as the Clang compiler or Polly loop optimiser. See the [LLVM releases](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#8.0.0)
       page for the complete list.

    2. Create a temporary build directory and `cd` into it, for example:
       ```sh
       $ mkdir /tmp/build
       $ cd /tmp/build
       ```

    3. Execute the following to configure the build. Here `INSTALL_PREFIX` is
       where LLVM is to be installed, for example `/usr/local` or
       `$HOME/opt/llvm`:
       ```sh
       $ cmake $LLVM_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON
       ```
       See [options and variables](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#options-and-variables)
       for a list of additional build parameters you can specify.

    4. Build and install:
       ```sh
       $ cmake --build .
       $ cmake --build . --target install
       ```

    5. For macOS only, some additional steps are useful to work around issues related
       to [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection):
       ```sh
       cd $INSTALL_PREFIX/lib
       ln -s libLLVM.dylib libLLVM-8.0.dylib
       install_name_tool -id $PWD/libLTO.dylib libLTO.dylib
       install_name_tool -id $PWD/libLLVM.dylib libLLVM.dylib
       install_name_tool -change '@rpath/libLLVM.dylib' $PWD/libLLVM.dylib libLTO.dylib
       ```


  Installing Accelerate-LLVM
  --------------------------

  Once the dependencies are installed, we are ready to install `accelerate-llvm`.

  For example, installation using [`stack`](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html)
  just requires you to point it to the appropriate configuration file:
  ```sh
  $ ln -s stack-8.6.yaml stack.yaml
  $ stack setup
  $ stack install
  ```

  Note that the version of [`llvm-hs`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-hs)
  used must match the installed version of LLVM, which is currently 8.0.


  ## libNVVM

  The `accelerate-llvm-ptx` backend can optionally be compiled to generate GPU
  code using the `libNVVM` library, rather than LLVM's inbuilt NVPTX code
  generator. `libNVVM` is a closed-source library distributed as part of the
  NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, and is what the `nvcc` compiler itself uses internally when
  compiling CUDA C code.

  Using `libNVVM` _may_ improve GPU performance compared to the code generator
  built in to LLVM. One difficulty with using it however is that since `libNVVM`
  is also based on LLVM, and typically lags LLVM by several releases, you must
  install `accelerate-llvm` with a "compatible" version of LLVM, which will depend
  on the version of the CUDA toolkit you have installed. The following table shows
  some combinations:

  |               | LLVM-3.3 | LLVM-3.4 | LLVM-3.5 | LLVM-3.8 | LLVM-3.9 | LLVM-4.0 | LLVM-5.0 | LLVM-6.0 | LLVM-7.0 | LLVM-8.0 |
  |:-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
  | **CUDA-7.0**  |     ⭕    |     ❌    |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-7.5**  |          |     ⭕    |     ⭕    |     ❌    |          |          |          |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-8.0**  |          |          |     ⭕    |     ⭕    |     ❌    |     ❌    |          |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-9.0**  |          |          |          |          |          |     ❌    |     ❌    |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-9.1**  |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-9.2**  |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-10.0** |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |
  | **CUDA-10.1** |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |

  Where ⭕ = Works, and ❌ = Does not work.

  Note that the above restrictions on CUDA and LLVM version exist _only_ if you
  want to use the NVVM component. Otherwise, you should be free to use any
  combination of CUDA and LLVM.

  Also note that `accelerate-llvm-ptx` itself currently requires at least LLVM-4.0.

  Using `stack`, either edit the `stack.yaml` and add the following section:

  ```yaml
  flags:
    accelerate-llvm-ptx:
      nvvm: true
  ```

  Or install using the following option on the command line:

  ```sh
  $ stack install accelerate-llvm-ptx --flag accelerate-llvm-ptx:nvvm
  ```

  If installing via `cabal`:

  ```sh
  $ cabal install accelerate-llvm-ptx -fnvvm
  ```
