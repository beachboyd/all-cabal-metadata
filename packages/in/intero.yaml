  Complete interactive development program for Haskell


  ## Intero for Emacs


  Please see

  [the homepage for Intero for Emacs](http://commercialhaskell.github.io/intero).


  #### Default key bindings


  Key binding | Description

  --- | ---

  `M-.` | Jump to definition

  `C-c C-i` | Show information of identifier at point

  `C-c C-t` | Show the type of thing at point, or the selection

  `C-u C-c C-t` | Insert a type signature for the thing at point

  `C-c C-l` | Load this module in the REPL

  `C-c C-c` | Evaluate the selected region in the REPL

  `C-c C-r` | Apply suggestions from GHC

  `C-c C-k` | Clear REPL

  `C-c C-z` | Switch to and from the REPL


  ## Enabling intero


  To enable `intero` in all `haskell-mode` buffers by default, enable

  `intero-global-mode`, by using `M-x customize` or by adding

  `(intero-global-mode 1)` to your Emacs start-up files.


  Intero will then activate for all projects, and for files without a

  stack.yaml, it will assume the "global" project. If you want to use an

  alternate stack yaml configuration file (for example, when developing

  for multiple GHC versions), use `M-x intero-stack-yaml` to switch

  file. When switching configuration, you will asked whether you want to

  preserve this choice across emacs sessions for the given project.


  ## Whitelisting/blacklisting projects


  Some users prefer to enable Intero selectively. The custom variables

  `intero-blacklist` and `intero-whitelist` are provided for this

  purpose, and are honoured by `intero-global-mode`:


  If the parent directory of a Haskell file is listed in

  `intero-blacklist`, then `intero` will not be enabled for that file,

  unless a parent directory of that file is also listed in

  `intero-whitelist`. In other words, whitelist entries take

  precedence. You can therefore blacklist `/` to disable `intero` in all

  projects unless they are whitelisted.



  ## Intero for IDE writers


  Please see

  [the TOOLING.md file for how to use Intero to integrate your own editor.](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero/blob/master/TOOLING.md).


  ## Issues


  Issues are split into low/medium/high priorities which dictates which

  ones will be implemented first.


  * [High priority issues](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22+)

  * [Medium priority issues](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22priority%3A+medium%22)

  * [Low priority issues](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22priority%3A+low%22)

  * [Unprioritized issues](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3A%22priority%3A+low%22++-label%3A%22priority%3A+medium%22++-label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22+)
