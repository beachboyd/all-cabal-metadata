  # indexed-containers: simple, no-frills indexed lists.

  This library contains lists whose types are indexed by their lengths. The implementation is a simple
  wrapper around a regular list.

  If the lengths of your lists are known statically, using indexed lists improves type safety
  with no runtime overhead.
