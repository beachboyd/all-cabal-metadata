description: ! "# intrinsic-superclasses\n\nA template haskell implementation of the
  [Intrinsic Superclasses Proposal](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/IntrinsicSuperclasses),
  which allows defining all typeclass methods at the \"root\" of the class heirarchy,
  rather than an instance declaration per class.\n\nThere are currently a number of
  limitations compared with the full language proposal (see: issues).\n\nFunctionality
  is added as-needed so drop an issue (and/or a pull request, if you're feeling ambitious
  \U0001F609) if you have a use-case that isn't covered now.\n"
