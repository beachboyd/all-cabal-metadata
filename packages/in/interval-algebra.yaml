description: "# interval-algebra\n\nThe `interval-algebra` package implements [Allen's
  interval algebra](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alspaugh/cls/shr/allen.html) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).
  The main module provides data types and related classes for the interval-based temporal
  logic described in [Allen (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1145/182.358434) and axiomatized
  in [Allen and Hayes (1987)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8640.1989.tb00329.x).
  \n\nA good primer on Allen's algebra can be [found here](https://thomasalspaugh.org/pub/fnd/allen.html).\n\n#
  Design\n\nThe module is built around three typeclasses designed to separate concerns
  of \nconstructing, relating, and combining `Interval`s: \n\n1. `Intervallic` provides
  an interface to the data structure of an `Interval`, defining how an `Interval a`
  (simply a pair `(a, a)`) is constructed.\n2. `IntervalAlgebraic` provides an interface
  to the `IntervalRelation`s, the workhorse of Allen's temporal logic.\n3. `IntervalCombinable`
  provides an interface to methods of combining multiple `Interval`s.\n\nAn advantage
  of nested typeclass design is that developers can define an \n`Interval` of type
  `a` with just the amount of structure that they need.\n\n## Total Ordering of `Interval`s
  \n\nThe modules makes the (opinionated) choice of a total ordering for `Intervallic`
  `Interval`s. Namely, the ordering is based on first ordering the `begin`s \nthen
  the `end`s.\n\n# Axiom tests\n\nThe package [includes tests](test/IntervalAlgebraSpec.hs)
  that the functions of the `IntervalAlgebraic` typeclass meets the axioms for _intervals_
  (not points) as laid out in [Allen and Hayes (1987)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8640.1989.tb00329.x).\n\n#
  Development\n\nThis module is under development and the API may change in the future.\n"
