description: ! 'The Haskell parser does not consider the fixity

  of operators when parsing infix applications.

  All infix applications are thus parsed as

  if the operators were all left associative with

  the same precedence.

  This module contains code for re-parsing infix

  applications taking into account the fixity of

  operators.

  The important algorithm is the well known

  operator precedence parsing algorithm. See

  comments in the code for more detailed

  information.'
