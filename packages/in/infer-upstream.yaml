description: ! "infer-upstream\n==============\n\nTakes a repo name, and looks up
  the upstream repository. If there is an\nupstream repository, writes it to standard
  out. Otherwise writes nothing.\n\nUsage:\n\n````\nnoon@dev> infer-upstream -r scirate3
  -u silky\ngit@github.com:draftable/scirate3.git\n````\n\nAnother usage:\n\n````\nnoon@dev>
  cd scirate3\nnoon@dev> git remote add upstream `infer-upstream --using-cwd`\n````\n\nA
  more interesting usage (and the reason I wrote this) is to use the\n`upstream_everything.sh`
  script.  It performs the following task.\n\nFor all folders in a given directory:\n\n
  \ * go into each one,\n  * if it is a github repo,\n  * look up the upstream repo,\n
  \ * if we find it,\n  * set it as a new remote.\n\nUsage:\n\n````\nnoon@~> cd dev\nnoon@dev>
  git clone git@github.com:silky/infer-upstream\nnoon@dev> infer-upstream/upstream_everything.sh\n...\n````\n\nWith
  `upstream` set on your repos, you can then run `fetch_upstreams.sh`, if\nyou like,
  which will bring down any incoming changes and give print out a\nshort summary.\n\nExample:\n\n````\nnoon@dev>infer-upstream/fetch_upstreams.sh
  \nfetching upstream for Javascript-Voronoi ...\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+),
  2 deletions(-)\n````\n\nNotes:\n\n  * This script assumes every folder in the ~/dev
  directory is the clone of a\n  Github repository.\n  * Github currently limits you
  to 60 unauthenticated API requests *per hour*;\n  this approach uses one API request
  per folder.\n\n\n"
