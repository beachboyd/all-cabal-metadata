description: ! 'AES encryption with optional hardware acceleration.  Plus,

  statistically sound, splittable random number generation based on AES.

  This package is nothing more than a wrapper around the Intel-provided

  AESNI sample library which also includes a portable software

  implementation of AES by Brian Gladman.  It contains C,

  assembly, and Haskell sources.  And it includes prebuilt dynamic

  libraries to make the build process less fragile.

  (Rebuilding requires the @yasm@ assembler.)  But prebuilt shared

  libraries are not included for all platforms yet.  (Volunteers

  needed!)

  Finally, note that this package is currently triggering some haddock

  problems. A manually built copy of the documentation can be found
