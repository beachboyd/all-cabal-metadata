description: An “inject function” is a regular monadic function (like a -> m b), but
  adds “injected parameters”. You can imagine such a function as an action taking
  parameters (the regular monadic function parameters) and vertical parameters. When
  you compose two compatible monadic functions (the regular way is through >=>), you
  can choose the types of the injected parameters so that, after some compositions,
  you have a total control of all the process.
