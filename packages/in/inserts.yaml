description: ! 'A template library that has two functions and a type in its API.


  Sometimes you need a powerful template library which allows for looping and

  conditional evaluation, deserialization from nearly every standard Haskell

  type, and manipulation of contexts abstractly. In those cases, I suggest

  @hastache@.


  Sometimes you just need to insert @ByteString@s into other @ByteString@s.

  In those cases, I suggest this library.'
