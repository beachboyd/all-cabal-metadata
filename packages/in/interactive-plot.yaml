  ====================

  [interactive-plot]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interactive-plot

  Quick time series terminal plotting for data exploration/in ghci.

  Most commonly used imports should be available in *Interactive.Plot*.

  Construct a `Series` from scratch using the raw data type, or use one of the
  handy helpers:

  1.  `listSeries`: Create a series from a list or any foldable.
  2.  `tupleSeries`: Create a series from a list of ordered-pair tuples providing
      x and y locations.
  3.  `funcSeries`: Create a series from a function `Double -> Double`, given a
      range of `x`s to produce the `y`s.

  Then simply "run" a list of series (or "automatic-styled series") using
  `runPlotAuto` or `runPlot`:

  ```haskell
  runPlotAuto
      :: PlotOpts         -- ^ options (can be 'defaultPlotOpts')
      -> Maybe String     -- ^ optional title
      -> [AutoSeries]     -- ^ uninitialized data of serieses
      -> IO ()
  ```

  These plots can be zoomed, stretched, scaled, panned interactively after
  launch.  If you quit, things resume back to the ghci session (or whatever point
  in the program you launch from).

  There are also options for rudimentary animations:

  ```haskell
  animatePlot
      :: PlotOpts
      -> Double           -- ^ update rate (frames per second)
      -> Maybe String     -- ^ title
      -> [[Series]]       -- ^ list of series data (potentially infinite)
      -> IO ()

  animatePlotFunc
      :: PlotOpts
      -> Maybe String                 -- ^ title
      -> (Double -> Maybe [Series])   -- ^ function from time to plot. will quit
                                      -- as soon as 'Nothing' is returned.
      -> IO ()
  ```

  Todo
  ----

  *   Consider being able to use functions directly as a series, instead of
      converting them into ordered pairs based on a known x series.
  *   I'm sure usability could always be improved :)
