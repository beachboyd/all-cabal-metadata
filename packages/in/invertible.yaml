description: ! "Haskell bidirectional arrows, bijective functions, and invariant functors\n\nRepresentations
  and operations for bidirectional arrows (total isomorphisms: an\narrow paired with
  its inverse).  Classes for invariant functors and monoidal\nfunctors.  Includes
  a number of useful bijections and operations, as well as\ninteroperability with
  related packages.\n\nSee also: semigroupoids, TypeCompose, lens, semi-iso, partial-isomorphisms,
  and\nPiso packages.\n\nArtem Alimarine, et al. There and Back Again: Arrows for
  Invertible\n  Programming. Haskell '05.\n"
