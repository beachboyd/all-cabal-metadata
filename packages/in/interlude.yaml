description: ! "\nSYNOPSIS\n\nInterlude is an include file and a module to use instead
  of the\n(often implicit) Prelude import.  It replaces some partial\nfunctions (i.e.
  functions that may fail on correctly typed input)\nwith pattern matches, so that
  a sensible error message that includes\nlocation can be printed out.  \n\nE.g. using
  the Prelude, \"head []\" results in \n\n   *** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list\n\nWith
  Interlude, you instead get:\n\n   *** Exception: Program error - 'head' failed:
  empty list. Location: test.hs line: 7\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nAs per the usual cabal
  incantations:\n    \n    ./Setup.hs configure\n    ./Setup.hs build\n    sudo ./Setup.hs
  install\n\n(Or add --user to configure in lieu of the sudo for install if you\ndon't
  have or want to use the privileges.)\n\n\nUSAGE\n\nReplace any implicit or explicit
  import of the Prelude with \n\n   #include <interlude.h>\n   import Interlude\n\nMake
  sure you compile with CPP, adding the {-# OPTIONS -cpp #-} pragma\nor -cpp to the
  command line works for GHC, in addition :s -cpp works for\nGHCi. \n\nYou may also
  #define a MESSAGE macro with a string to print after any \nerror.  Useful to point
  out the address to contact for support, for\nintstance. \n\n\nBUGS\n\nYou will not
  be able to hide or qualify the functions replaced by\nthe Interlude.  As the names
  will be expanded in the imports, expect\nsome messy error messages if you try.\n\nThe
  C preprocessor doesn't care much for macro expansion in the\npresence of primes
  used as variable names, and using these replacement\nfunctions on the same line
  as single quotes will usually not work.\nSee the file example.hs for an example\n"
