synopsis: A library for writing CGI programs
changelog: ! "# Change Log\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\nThis project adheres to the [Package Versioning Policy](https://wiki.haskell.org/Package_versioning_policy).\n\n##
  [3001.3.0.3]\n### Changed\n- Bumped upper version bounds for containers and time.\n-
  Updated to exceptions 0.10.x. This meant extending our `MonadMask` instance\n  to
  provide the `generalBracket` method that was added to the class in recent\n  versions
  of the exceptions library.\n- The doctest suite would not work reliably with different
  versions of Cabal.\n  Instead of going all out with a custom written build system
  to support it\n  properly, we now run doctests as part of our CI builds but not
  as a part of\n  the Cabal build any more.\n- Fixed several compiler warnings in
  our code.\n\n## [3001.3.0.2]\n### Changed\n- Bumped QuickCheck upper bound to version
  < 2.10\n\n## [3001.3.0.1]\n### Changed\n- Bumped doctest to version < 0.12\n\n##
  [3001.3.0.0]\n### Changed\n- Cookie.hs: cookieExpires now has type `Maybe UTCTime`
  rather than\n`Maybe CalendarTime`\n- Protocol.hs: URL decoding functions no longer
  decode UTF-8 encoding\n- Functor and Applicative instance of CGIT no longer constrain
  Functor or\nApplicative parameter to be an instance of Monad\n\n## [3001.2.2.3]\n###
  Changed\n* CGI.hs haddock: Use web.archive.org link for CGI specification\n\n##
  [3001.2.2.2]\n### Changed\n- Added support for building with mtl < 2.2.1 via flags\n\n##
  [3001.2.2.1]\n### Changed\n- Bumped exceptions version to < 0.9\n\n## [3001.2.2.0]\n###
  Added\n- MonadMask instance for CGIT\n\n## [3001.2.1.0]\n### Added\n- Applicative
  instance for CGI Monad\n\n### Changed\n- Deduplicate shared with `multipart` code\n\n##
  3001.2.0.0\n### Changed\n- GHC 7.8.3 support\n\n[Unreleased]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.3.0.2...HEAD\n[3001.3.0.2]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.3.0.1...3001.3.0.2\n[3001.3.0.1]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.3.0.0...3001.3.0.1\n[3001.3.0.0]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.2.2.3...3001.3.0.0\n[3001.2.2.3]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.2.2.2...3001.2.2.3\n[3001.2.2.2]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.2.2.1...3001.2.2.2\n[3001.2.2.1]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.2.2.0...3001.2.2.1\n[3001.2.2.0]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.2.1.0...3001.2.2.0\n[3001.2.1.0]:\nhttps://github.com/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/compare/3001.2.0.0...3001.2.1.0\n"

  build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi/master.svg?label=travis+build)](https://travis-ci.org/cheecheeo/haskell-cgi)\n\nThis
  is a Haskell library for writing CGI programs.\nIts features include:\n\n- Access
  to CGI parameters (e.g. form input) from both\n  GET and POST requests.\n- Access
  to CGI environment variables.\n- Ability to set arbitrary response headers.\n- Support
  for HTTP cookies.\n- An efficient implementation of multipart/form-data\n  using
  Data.ByteString. This allows for efficient\n  handling of file uploads.\n- Wrapper
  functions for compatibility with the old\n  Network.CGI module.\n- A CGI monad transformer.\n-
  Basic exception handling and logging (these should be improved)\n- Low-level run
  functions that allow using programs written with\n  this package with protocols
  other than CGI, for example FastCGI.\n\nOn hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cgi\nSource:
