changelog: |
  1.0:

  * Change representation of decimals to an inherently normalized form
    that is symmetric with respect to positive and negative numbers.

  * singularize module names

  * separate Decimal and general representation

  * use Proxys instead of plain types for data functions
    This is also consistent with new Nat kind,
    where types of kind Nat have no data values.

  * Ord: make infix operators classes and prefix functions type functions
    It seems to be more natural to me to write
       x :<: y   and   GTT x y ~ True

  * Num, Bool, Ord: remove T suffixes from functions
    Use qualification instead.

description: |-
  TFP is an abbreviation for Type Family Programming.
  It provides implementations of type-level integers and booleans,
  and (eventually) simple type-level data structures.
  It uses type families as functions to produce new types,
  which provides an intuitive way to parameterize data types
  and functions on numerical values at compile time.
