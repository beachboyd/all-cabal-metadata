  ===


  A Haskell library providing Item Response Theory functions for use in computerized
  adaptive testing. Provided functionality is similar to the CAT portions of the `catIrt`
  R library, though only the binary-response model is currently supported.


  IRT bucks the standard trend of starting Haskell libraries/executables with ''H'',
  since `hirt` already exists.
