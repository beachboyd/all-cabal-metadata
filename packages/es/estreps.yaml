description: ! "\nSYNOPSIS\n\n    rselect - select a random set of sequences from
  a FASTA file.\n    reps    - extract exact k-word repeats based that occur in\n
  \             sequences grouped in different clusters.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    You'll
  need GHC or possibly another Haskell system, and the\n    Haskell bioinformatics
  library.  The Makefile should work to\n    build and install (by default to your
  home directory) the\n    executables.\n\nUSAGE\n\n      rselect [-r] n [m] input.seq\n\n
  \   Selects n sequences from the file input.seq.  If the optional\n    m is given,
  this limits the selection to happen only from the first\n    m sequences in the
  file, which may be more efficient.  If -r is given,\n    the sequences will be reoriented
  randomly.\n\n    The selected sequences are written to standard output, so you\n
  \   probably want to redirect them to a file.\n\n      reps k clustered.seq\n\n
  \   Generate a list of repeated k-words (or k-grams) found in the sequences.\n    The
  sequences are expected to be on UniGene format, i.e. a FASTA file\n    with #-initiated
  comments separating the clusters.\n\n    A k-word is considered repeated if it is
  found in more than one of the\n    clusters.\n\n      reps k clustering.lst sequences.seq\n\n
  \   As above, but take a separate input clustering (and ignore any #'s in the\n
  \   sequences.  The clustering should consist of one line per cluster, with each\n
  \   line containing the sequence identifier (first word after the initial '>'\n
  \   in the FASTA header).\n\nBUGS\n\n    Do let me know about them, at <ketil@malde.org>!\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\n
