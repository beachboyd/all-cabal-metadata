description: ! 'Provides a function lcs that takes two lists and returns a longest

  common sublist. For example, lcs "abcd" "acbd" is either "abd" or

  "acd".


  The package provides a simple, stupid and (most of all) slow

  implementation that needs, for inputs of length m and n, O(m+n)

  space and O((m+n)!) time in the worst case.


  It also provides an implementation of the Hunt-Szymanski LCS

  algorithm, based on that in "String searching algorithms" by

  Graham A Stephen, ISBN 981021829X.


  Given inputs xs and ys of length m and n respectively, where there

  are r pairs (x, y) where x is in xs, y is in ys and x == y,

  Hunt-Szymanski needs O(r+m+n) space and O((r+m+n)*log(m+n)) time.

  Thus this is O((m+n)^2) space and O((m+n)^2*log(m+n)) time in the

  worst case.'
