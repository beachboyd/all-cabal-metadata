description: Hevolisa is an application that tries to approximate a bitmap image with
  colored polygons. It draws a set of random polygons which are changed/mutated in
  small random steps. There is an error function which compares the bitmap created
  from the polygons with the original image. If the error between the images is smaller
  than before then the new image replaces the old. This is done over and over again.
