  ============


  A quick guide to building:


  ./configure --prefix=/wherever/you/want/it

  make

  make install


  If you make changes to the code, in particular the imports, you may need

  to also run make dep.



  All of my code is released under the GNU GPL version 2. The files in the

  CTAN directory was written by other people and their licences apply.



  Enjoy!

  Ian
