  Would you like to have nice, up-to-date license/copyright headers in your source code files but hate to manage them manually? Then __Headroom__ is the right tool for you. Define your license header as [Mustache][web:mustache] template, put any template variables into [YAML][wiki:yaml] configuarion file, and you're ready to go!

  __Headroom__ also offers much more than just [adding, replacing or dropping][doc:running-headroom] license headers. It can also [update years in copyrights][doc:post-processing] for you, provides [extended functionality][doc:extended-functionality] for some source code file types, and much more!

  [![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/4Pfxdss0V4msFjjt2z6mgCZCp.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/4Pfxdss0V4msFjjt2z6mgCZCp)

  ## Main Features
  - __License Header Management__ - [Add, replace or drop license headers][doc:running-headroom] in your source code files with a single command. What's more, contrary to many similar tools, _Headroom_ allows you to also replace/drop headers that weren't previously generated by _Headroom_, using smart header auto-detection.
  - __Powerful Customization__ - Default [configuration][doc:configuration] should cover most use-cases, but if you need to put empty lines before/after generated header, use different comment style of headers, you can customize the configuration to match exactly your needs.
  - __Built-in OSS License Headers__ - If you want to use license header for one of the popular OSS licenses, then __Headroom__ can [generate them for you][doc:running-headroom#gen-command] - no need to search for them on web.
  - __Automatic Initialization for OSS Projects__ - Setting up external tools like _Headroom_ for your project can be boring. Fortunately, _Headroom_ can [initialize itself][doc:running-headroom#init-command] for your project, by generating configuration file and template files.
  - __Extended Functionality__ - _Headroom_ supports [extended functionality][doc:extended-functionality] for selected types of source code files, such as extracting extra data from processed source code files.
  - __Copyright Year Updater__ - _Headroom_ is good not only for basic license header management, but also for further processing of generated headers. Do you need to [update years in your copyrights][doc:post-processing]? No problem!
