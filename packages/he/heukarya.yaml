description: ! 'It based on Data.Dynamic and tree container, so that Gene can represent
  both haskell functions and syntax trees by type connstructors. since it also supports
  higher order functions by multiple way type parsing, there''s no need to have any
  variable in Gene''s Tree structure.


  take a look at module AI.Heukarya.Center first


  AI.Heukarya.Gene : Abstract Gene manipulation and Typeclass for implementing data
  types under tree structure


  AI.Heukarya.Jungle : Operating Collections of Gene


  AI.Heukarya.Center : Module which wraps main functionality for library using



  AI.Heukarya.Gene.Dynamic : one of Gene''s implementation. since it''s impossible
  to save checkpoints if using Data.Dynamic directly, a symbolic wrapper around dynamic
  is provied inside


  AI.Heukarya.Gene.Dynamic.Double : a sample geneList of operators of Double precision
  numbers'
