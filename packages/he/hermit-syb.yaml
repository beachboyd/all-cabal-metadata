description: ! 'A HERMIT plugin for GHC which optimizes SYB generic traversals to
  achieve equivalent performance to hand-written traversals.


  Details can be found in the paper: <http://michaeldadams.org/papers/syb-opt/>


  Note: This compiler plugin requires GHC 7.8 (or HEAD) and specially compiled copies
  of base, ghc-prim, and syb.

  Up-to-date instructions can be found at: <https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/wiki/GHC-HEAD>.
  We are working to

  lift these requirements.


  As an example, we apply the optimization to Foo.hs, which contains the following
  code:


  @

  module Main where


  import Data.Generics

  import HERMIT.Optimization.SYB.Prelude


  main :: IO ()

  main = print (mapInt (+1) [1..10])


  mapInt :: (Int -> Int) -> [Int] -> [Int]

  mapInt f = everywhere (mkT f)

  @


  Note that importing @HERMIT.Optimization.SYB.Prelude@ is required in any module
  targeted for optimization.


  To compile Foo.hs with the optimization:


  @

  $ hermit Foo.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt

  @


  This invokes GHC with a specific set of flags. These flags may be used instead of
  the ''hermit'' program itself, or placed in a cabal file.


  The first argument to HERMIT is the target file. Next is the -opt flag, which specifies
  the plugin name.

  Then follows one or more target module names, each beginning with a plus sign. After
  each target module is a list of targeted functions.

  The distinguished ''interactive'' target will run the optimization on any other
  targets and then enter the HERMIT interactive shell.

  The distinguished ''interactive-only'' target will open the HERMIT shell before
  optimization.

  HERMIT commands specific to this optimization are available for interactive use.'
