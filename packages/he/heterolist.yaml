description: ! 'A heterogeneous list type (i.e. a list with different element types)
  which knows the type of it''s elements.

  There are also various functions for manipulating such lists, although this is not
  yet complete.

  Some of the standard type classes, like Eq, Ord and Show are defined for these heterogeneous
  lists.

  I suspect it could be particularly useful for testing libraries which may want to
  test against a variety of

  types in a uniform fashion.'
