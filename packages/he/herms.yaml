changelog: ! "-*-change-log-*-\n\nv1.8.1.4 - 11 March 2017\n\t\t\t\t * The meta update!
  Added version flag (\"-v\" and \"--version\")\n\nv1.8.1.3 - 11 March 2017\n\t\t\t\t
  * Tags may now contain multiple words. If herms detects commas in the\n\t\t\t\t
  tag entry field, then a recipe's tags will be comma-separated strings\n\t\t\t\t
  rather than space-separated words.\n\nv1.8.1.2 - 18 October 2017\n         * Initial
  release\n"

description: ! "# Herm's\n\n![Travis build](https://api.travis-ci.org/JackKiefer/herms.svg?branch=master)\n\nHeRM's:
  a Haskell-based Recipe Manager (yes, food recipes) for the command line.\n\n![Herm's
  Interface](https://i.imgur.com/u9fPapw.jpg)\n\n### Features\n- Add recipes! :)\n-
  Look at recipes! :D\n- Edit recipes! :DD\n- Serving size adjustment! :DDD\n- Remove
  recipes :(\n- View metric recipes in imperial units and vice-versa\n- Import recipe
  files\n- Generate shopping lists\n- Keep track of recipes with tags\n\n### What's
  new:\n- Set default unit systems, serving sizes, and recipe file path in ``config.hs``!\n
  \   - Coming soon: Multi-language support\n- Added support for multi-word tags\n-
  Check your Herm's version with ``-v`` or ``--version``\n- Herm's is now on Stackage!\n\n###
  Installation\n\n#### PATH setup\n\nFirstly, make sure that the following is added
  to your PATH:\n\n```\n~/.cabal/bin\n```\n\n#### Download and install\n\nAt the moment,
  Herm's can only be compiled from source, but binaries are in the works!\n\n#####
  Manually cloning and installing from source with Stack _(recommended)_:\n\n```\ngit
  clone https://github.com/JackKiefer/herms\ncd herms\nstack update\nstack install\n```\n\n#####
  Via Hackage and Cabal:\n\n```\ncabal update\ncabal install herms\n```\n\n##### Manually
  with Cabal:\n\nYour milage may vary with dependency resolution\n\n```\ngit clone
  https://github.com/JackKiefer/herms\ncd herms\ncabal update\ncabal install -j\n```\n\n###
  Usage\n\n#### Command-line interface \n\nHerm's has a pretty intuitive interface
  for users familiar with other command-line programs! \n\nBelow is the exhaustive
  list of all commands and their functionalities. Take a gander!\n\n```\nUsage:\n\n
  \       herms list [-g|--group] [--tags TAGS]           list recipes\n                   [--name-only
  ]\n \n        herms add                                       add a new recipe (interactively)\n\n
  \       herms edit RECIPE_NAME                          edit a recipe\n\n        herms
  import FILE_NAME                          import a recipe file\n\n        herms
  remove RECIPE_NAMES                       remove the particular recipes\n\n        herms
  view RECIPE_NAMES [-s|--serving INT]      view the particular recipes\n                                [-t|--step]\n
  \                               [-c|--convert CONV_UNIT] \n\n        herms shopping
  RECIPE_NAMES [-s|--serving INT] generate shopping list for particular recipes\n\n
  \       herms datadir                                  print location of recipe
  and config files\n\nAvailable options:\n\n        -h|--help                                      Show
  this help text\n\n        -v|--version                                   Show version\n\n
  \       RECIPE_NAME                                    index or Recipe name\n\n
  \       --sort SORT_ORDER                              'tags' to sort by tags\n\n
  \       -s|--serving INT                               specify serving size when
  viewing.\n                                                       E.g., 'herms view
  -s 2 {recipe}' for two servings\n\n        -t|--step                                      View
  recipe in \"one-step-at-a-time\" mode\n                                                       (press
  enter between each direction)\n\n        -g|--group                                     group
  recipes by tags\n\n        --tags TAGS                                    show recipes
  with particular flags\n\n        --name-only                                    only
  list recipes by name\n\n        -c|--convert CONV_UNIT                         view
  the recipe converted to imperial or metric\n                                                       E.g.,
  'herms view 2 -c imperial'\n```\n\n#### Configuring Herm's and managing recipe files\n\nHerm's
  stores its recipes file, ``recipes.herms``,  and configuration file, ``config.hs``,
  in the same directory. Herm's keeps track of its location! Run ``herms datadir``
  to see the full directory path.\n\n``config.hs`` is a pseudo-Haskell-source-code
  file with several options for configuring the behaviour of Herm's. It currently
  supports the following options:\n\n- `defaultUnit` : The default unit system to
  show recipes in. Options: `Imperial`, `Metric`, `None`. Setting to `None` will simply
  show recipes in whatever unit system they're stored in.\n- `defaultServingSize`
  : Default serving size to calculate when showing recipes. Can be any non-negative
  integer; set to `0` for no default. This can be useful when you're always cooking
  for the same number of people!\n- `recipesFile` : The recipes file and relative
  location. Make sure the file already exists by running `touch FILENAME` before running
  Herm's or it will throw a fit. This option currently supports relative location,
  as well; if your data directory is `~/herms/data`, for example, and you want a recipe
  file in your home directoy called `~/GrandmasHugeCookbook.herms`, set this option
  to `\"../../GrandmasHugeCookbook.herms\"`.\n\n\n---\n\nIn honor of Logan, Utah's
