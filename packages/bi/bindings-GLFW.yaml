description: ! "bindings-GLFW\n=============\n\n## Description\n\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/bindings-GLFW.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-GLFW)\n\nLow-level
  [Haskell][1] bindings to [GLFW][2], an open source, multi-platform\nlibrary for
  creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input and\nevents.\n\nThe binding
  is to [GLFW 3.1 released 2015-01-18][3].\n\n*These bindings are too low-level for
  normal use.* For higher-level GLFW\nbindings, see [GLFW-b][4].\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis
  package uses git-flow as development model, in short that means that:\n\n1. New
  features should be added to \"develop\" branch.\n2. \"master\" branch is reserved
  for stable releases.\n3. Patches for bugs related with previous releases should
  always be done in\n    \"hotfixes\" branch.\n4. All merge commits to master from
  \"hotfixes\" should be done\n    using the \"--no-ff\" flag and from \"develop\"
  should avoid merging commits.\n\nUntil we have a defined road-map we are going to
  leave out \"release\n\"branches\" and \"feature branches\". For more information
  about this development\nmodel please refer to [this site.][5]\n\nThanks you, and
  happy coding.\n\n[1]: http://www.haskell.org/\n[2]: http://www.glfw.org/\n[3]: http://www.glfw.org/Version-3.1-released.html\n[4]:
