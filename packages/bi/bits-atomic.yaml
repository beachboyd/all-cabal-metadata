description: ! 'Atomic operations including CAS (compare-and-swap), fetch & add and
  variants

  suitable for low-level shared-memory synchronization.


  The implementation is using GCC''s builtin atomic operations (available in GCC >=

  4) in C wrappers called through the FFI. See these links for background:


  * GCC manual: <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html>


  * GCC wiki: <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic>


  /Portability/: This package is primarily developed on a Linux system, but

  should work wherever GCC >= 4 is available. It has been confirmed as working

  on OSX. On Windows, it should work with Cygwin but currently fails for

  vanilla Haskell-Platform 2010.1.0.0 as it still packages GCC 3.x. An

  installer for updated versions of GCC is available at

  <http://www.mingw.org/> and should make this package work in connection with

  Haskell-Platform. Feedback on compatibility would be appreciated.


  /Testing:/ The following commands can be used to compile and run the test suite:


  > cabal unpack bits-atomic && cd bits-atomic-* # if not yet locally available

  > cabal configure -ftest

  > cabal build

  > cabal test


  /Recent changes/:


  * 0.1.3: Documentation updates, especially on portability. No functional

  changes.


  * 0.1.2: Avoid using System.FilePath in Setup.hs to fix build failure on hackage'
