synopsis: Bitmap library
changelog: ! "PLACEHOLDER\n-----\n\n0.2.6.3\n-----\n* Fixed build errors.\n  * Hide
  imports of `get` from `Control.Monad.Record`.\n  * Support ``bitmap-0.0.2``s new
  major API changes that don't conform to the\n    cabal's package versioning policy.\n
  \ * Replaced imports of `Foreign` with `System.IO.Unsafe` for `unsafePerformIO`.\n
  \   `Foreign` no longer provides `unsafePerformIO`.\n  * Replaced calls to `lens`
  with calls to `lensGS`, since fc-labels recently\n    changed lens to take a getter
  and a modifier rather than a getter and a\n    setter.  Eventually this library
  will be ported from `fc-labels` to `lens`,\n    which was written after this project
  was first developed.\n* Fixed warnings.\n  * Removed redundant import of `Control.Bitmap.Searchable`
  from\n    `Data.Bitmap.String.Internal`.\n\n0.2.6.2\n-----\n* Add homepage and bug-reports
  to cabal file, linking to the github repository\n  and its issue tracker, respectively.\n*
  Added `CHANGELOG.md`.\n"
