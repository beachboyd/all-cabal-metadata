description: ! 'This package contains bindings to GTS (<http://gts.sourceforge.net>)

  library using bindings-DSL macros and style. Like GObject,

  it''s not useful by itself, but as a foundation for other

  libraries making use of its type system.


  NOTE: these bindings were not made by the author(s) of GTS

  so please don''t bug them about issues with the bindings! Any

  errors in these bindings are my responsibility not that of

  the GTS team.


  Changelog:


  [0.0.1] Initial version.


  [0.0.2] Improved documentation; added some missing functions;

  fixed a function name; bumped version of base to >=4


  [0.0.3] Adding missing GTS enumeration for CSG boolean

  operations; added some more missing functions; fixed some bad

  FunPtr references; added some helper methods, added missing

  GTS_inline.h header to sdist archive


  [0.1.1] Bindings reorganized by Maur√≠cio Antunes, author

  of Bindings-DSL. Bindings much improved as a result. This

  is an incompatible API change but should be the last change

  to the package organization. Should now cover all of the GTS

  library. Some features (GSList etc) moved into Bindings-GLib

  (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-glib>)

  as they should be there.
