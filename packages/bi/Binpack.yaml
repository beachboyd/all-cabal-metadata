description: ! 'An implementation of the first-fit, modified-first-fit, last-fit,
  best-fit,

  sum-of-squares-fit, worst-fit, and almost-last-fit bin packing

  heuristics. Items can be packed in order of both decreasing and increasing

  size (and, of course, in unmodified order).


  The module supports both the standard (textbook) minimization problem

  (/How many bins do I need?/) and the more practical fitting problem

  (/I''ve got n bins; which items can I take?/).


  The API is simple and the module is documented with Haddock (complete with

  examples). The implementation of the above-mentioned heuristics is complete

  and partially tested with QuickCheck. However, note that speed has not been a

  primary concern to date.


  Patches and feedback are very welcome.'
