description: ! "Description\n-----------\nThis library allows you to control the Velleman
  K8055, a usb experiment interface board.\n\nThe board has:\n\n * 5 digital inputs\n
  * 2 analog inputs\n * 8 digital outputs\n * 2 analog outputs\n\nHow is works\n------------\nVelleman
  provides a `K8055D.dll`, so this is a **Windows-only solution**, to interact with
  the board.\nA FFI interface has been written to interact with the dll functions.\nFor
  this I had to create a definition file `K8055D.def` and run `dlltool -k -d K8055D.def
  -l K8055D.dll.a`.\n\nSome Background\n---------------\nMy first attempt at interfacing
  this board was using `bindings-libusb`. After getting is to work\non Linux I was
  unable to compile it on Windows. Because my solution should work on Windows\nI chose
  to interface the existing dll.\n\nI haven't given up on the my first solution, it's
  still the cleanest way to go, having no\nK8055 specific, native library dependencies
  and being platform-independent.\n\nInstall\n-------\nAs mentioned earlier, we need
  the `K8055D.dll`. This can be obtained by downloading the official\n[Velleman K8055
  SDK]. Extract it and put the dll, `DLL_v4.0.0.0/K8055D.dll`, somewhere in PATH,\ne.g.
  `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\nThen all you need to do is install the cabal package:\n\n
  \   cabal install Bindings-K8055\n\nExample\n-------\nPress a button, digital in,
  an run the following code:\n\n    import Bindings.K8055\n\n    main :: IO ()\n    main
  =\n      withDevice Card1 (readAllDigital >>= print)\n\nOr using ghci:\n\n    >
  import Bindings.K8055\n    > withDevice Card1 (readAllDigital >>= print)\n    0\n\n\n[Velleman
