description: ! 'This package provides deriveGet and derivePut which

  can be used to quickly create an instance of Binary for any time which

  implements Generic. Naturally, this can be used with -XDeriveGeneric to not     have
  to write any boilerplate code. This differs from binary-generic which

  relies on the Data class instead and doesn''t seem to have quite the same

  implementation philosophy. Once Ghc 7.2 is stable, this could be combined

  into the binary package to provide a sensible default for the Binary class.'
