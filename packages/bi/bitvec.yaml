  Bit vectors library for Haskell.

  The current [vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector)
  package represents unboxed arrays of 'Bool'
  allocating one byte per boolean, which might be considered wasteful.
  This library provides a newtype wrapper 'Data.Bit.Bit' and a custom instance
  of unboxed 'Data.Vector.Unboxed.Vector', which packs booleans densely.
  It is a time-memory tradeoff: 8x less memory footprint
  at the price of moderate performance penalty
  (mostly, for random writes).

  === Thread safety
  * "Data.Bit" is faster, but thread-unsafe. This is because
  naive updates are not atomic operations: read the whole word from memory,
  modify a bit, write the whole word back.
  * "Data.Bit.ThreadSafe" is slower (up to 2x), but thread-safe.

  === Similar packages

  * [bv](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bv)
  and [bv-little](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bv-little)
  offer only immutable size-polymorphic bit vectors.
  @bitvec@ provides an interface to mutable vectors as well.

  * [array](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array)
  is memory-efficient for 'Bool', but lacks
  a handy 'Vector' interface and is not thread-safe.
