description: |-
  Another bit-array library for Haskell.  This one defines a `Bit`
  type (which is an instance of all the "expected" classes, including
  numeric ones) and makes that type an instance of `Data.Vector.Unboxed.
  Unbox`, so we get a lot of nice APIs for free.  `Bool` is already an
  unboxable type, but the current unboxed `Vector` implementation packs
  each bit as a byte.  This one packs 8 bits per byte, as expected
  (`UArray` from the `array` package also uses one bit per `Bool`).

  In addition to the `Vector` interface, there are several high-level
  operations and some low-level ones suitable for building new bulk
  operations by viewing the bit-vector as a word vector.
