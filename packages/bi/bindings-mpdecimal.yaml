  Bindings to the mpdecimal library by Stefan Krah, which is available at


  http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal


  mpdecimal provides decimal floating point arithmetic.  It currently is

  the basis for the decimal library in the Python standard library.

  More information on decimal arithmetic is at


  http://speleotrove.com/decimal/


  These bindings were written for mpdecimal version 2.4.0.  You will

  need to install mpdecimal before you install this library.


  These bindings were made using bindings-dsl:
