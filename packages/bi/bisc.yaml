  # Bisc
  ### A small tool that clears qutebrowser cookies

  ## Configuration

  The bisc configuration file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bisc/bisc.conf`.
  It allows to change the paths of the QtWebEngine/Chromium
  directory and the whitelist file.
  The default settings are:
  ```
  whitelist-path = $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/qutebrowser/whitelists/cookies
  webengine-path = $(XDG_DATA_HOME)/qutebrowser/webengine
  ```

  ## Usage

  Create an empty whitelist file and write the domains of the
  allowed cookies, one per line.
  Eg.
  ```
  .example.com
  example.com
  ```

  Run `bisc` to delete all non-whitelisted data from qutebrowser.
