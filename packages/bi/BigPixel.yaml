description: ! "BigPixel\n========\n\nBigPixel is an image editor for pixel art. It
  is aimed at creating graphics assets for retro or Minecraft-style 2D games. It supports
  the creation of pixelated images with 8x8 big pixels in 256 colours with 16 levels
  of transparency. It is an OpenGL-based cross-platform application. BigPixel currently
  only supports the BMP image format.\n\nAs BigPixel is a plain OpenGL application
  without platform-specific GUI support, you need to start it as a command line program
  and supply it with the name of a BMP image file as its sole command line argument.
  If the file exists, it will be opened for editing; otherwise, a new file will be
  created. All changes made to an image are persistent — i.e., reflected in the on
  disk image without explicit saving.\n\n    Left mouse button          — draw with
  current colour\n    Left mouse button + Shift  — erase with transparency\n    Right
  mouse button         — erase with transparency\n    'W', 'S', 'A', 'D'         —
  enlarge canvas to the top, bottom, left, and right, respectively\n    'W', 'S',
  'A', 'D' + Shift — shrink canvas from the top, bottom, left, and right, respectively\n\n**WARNING:**
  There is currently no undo facility! Make copies of image files if you are unsure
  whether you like to keep the changes. (However, if you shrink the visible canvas,
  the removed content can be restored by simply enlarging the canvas again.)\n\n![Screenshot

  to have the Glasgow Haskell Compiler to compile from source. It is available as
  part of the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/).\n\nTo install
  the current release of BigPixel from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html),
  simply execute\n\n    % cabal install BigPixel\n\nTo install the current version
  from GitHub, \n\n    % git clone https://github.com/mchakravarty/BigPixel.git\n
  \   % cd BigPixel\n    % cabal install\n\nHacking\n-------\n\nThe Haskell code is
  relatively simple on purpose. It is part of an effort to teach programming to children.
  Contributions are most welcome, but please keep them in this spirit.\n"
