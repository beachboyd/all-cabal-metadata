description: ! '# bibdb


  bibdb is a simple citation resolver and bibliography manager for BibTeX. Instead
  of manually copy pasting bibliographies, you specify a reference to the work you
  want to cite (by providing a DOI or a DBLP key, for example) in a simple domain
  specific language. bibdb is then responsible for fetching the citations, renaming
  them, removing duplicates, and sorting them properly (to handle cross-references).


  # Usage


  A bibdb file might look like the following:

  ```

  -- Papers

  DBLP:books/aw/Knuth68

  DBLP:conf/fossacs/PfenningG15 as PfenningG15

  DOI:10.1145/800157.805047 as Cook71


  -- Conferences

  DBLP:conf/popl/2016 as Popl16

  ```


  Note how we can use comments (with `--` or `{- ... -}`) and rename references using
  `as`. References without an explicit name inherit the source address. For example,
  the first reference will have the name `DBLP:books/aw/Knuth68` in the generated
  bibliography file. After we create the file, we invoke bibdb:

  ```

  bibdb references.bibdb -o references.bib

  ```

  (here, we assume the file is named `references.bibdb`). bibdb can generate compressed
  citations or full citations with cross-references where available. For more information
  on the allowed commands, see `bibdb --help`.



  # Comparison to Similar Tools


  * [dblp](https://github.com/grundprinzip/dblp) is a command line tool that parses
  a TeX file and resolves all references to DBLP. This makes it unnecessary to maintain
  a separate file. However, dblp cannot resolve other types of references, and it
  gives no way to rename them.


  * [citation-resolve](https://github.com/nushio3/citation-resolve) is a package for
  resolving citations. It can handle more types of references but it is not a tool
  on its own. We might use it internally in the future.



  # Language Specification


  bibdb files have a very simple grammar. `--` is used for single line comments and
  `{- ... -}` for multi-line nested comments. Each entry is of the form `<source-type>
  : <source-key> [as <name>]`. A file is simply a list of entries.


  Currently, `<source-type>` can only be `DBLP` or `DOI`. We may add more in the future.
