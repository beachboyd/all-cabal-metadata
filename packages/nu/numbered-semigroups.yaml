description: |-
  Some types are composable in multiple “directions”, either in
  a literal sense (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams diagrams>
  can be stacked vertically, as well as layed out side-by-side)
  or in an abstraction (matrices etc.). This package offers a whole
  sequence of semigroup-classes, numbered by type-literals, as
  a unified interface for composition of such types. It also has
  a bunch of standardised operators for writing out the compositions
  in a snug way.
