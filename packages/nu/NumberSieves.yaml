synopsis: ! 'Number Theoretic Sieves:  primes, factorization, and Euler''s Totient'
changelog: ! "Version 0.1.2:  (2012-08-21)\n  * Added Show constraints for compatibility
  with recent versions of\n    GHC,  as Show is no longer a superclass of Integral\n\n
  \ * Applied a patch from Melissa O'Neill that fixes the priority queue\n    in her
  sieve.   This bug does not effect the prime generation\n\nVersion 0.1.1:  (2010-09-02)\n
  \ * Changed the module naming hierarchy from NumberTheory.* to Math.*\n\n  * Added
  a test suite\n\n  * Improved Haddock documentation\n\n  * Added a link to the darcs
  repository in the .cabal file\n\n  * Changed the Category in the .cabal file\n\nVersion
  0.0:    (2009-07-13)\n\n  * Initial Release\n"

description: This package includes the Sieve of O'Neill and two generalizations of
  the Sieve of Eratosthenes.   The Sieve of O'Neill is a fully incremental primality
  sieve based on priority queues.  The other two are array based, and are not incremental.   One
  sieves the smallest prime factor,  and is useful if you want to factor a large quantity
  of small numbers.   The other sieves Euler's Totient,  which is the number of positive
  integers relatively prime and less than a given number.
