description: ! "null-canvas is as fork of blank-canvas with some changes \nto make
  it more configurable and composable with other software.\n\nThe name has been changed
  to avoid confusion within .cabal files.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nblank-canvas
  is a Haskell port of the HTML5 Canvas API.\nTutorials and examples for the HTML5
  for the HTML5 Canvas\nshould be trivial to port to this library.\n\nblank-canvas
  works by providing a web service, that\ndisplays the users' Haskell commands inside
  a browser.\n\nThere are several examples inside the 'examples' directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n--\nFPG
