synopsis: Arduino programming in haskell using the Copilot stream DSL
changelog: |
  arduino-copilot (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

    * New Copilot.Arduino.Library.EEPROMex module.
    * Serial: Added FlashString, to display strings directly from flash
      without copying into ram.
    * Added millis and micros.
    * MicroSeconds and MilliSeconds types changed to contain a Word32 not a
      Word16.
    * Renamed Voltage to ADC
    * Added frequency.

  arduino-copilot (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

    * New polymorphic "input" action that can be used to read digital and
      analog pins, as well as read from serial ports, and replaces
      readfrom, readvoltage, etc.
    * Replaced PWMDutyCycle with pwm.
    * Changed the Serial and XBee modules to work with the =: operator
      and "input".

  arduino-copilot (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Bugfix: Doing the same kind of write to two different pins in the
      same program caused the C generated by Copilot to not compile.
    * Several changes making the API more FRP style, including adding
      Behavior and Event types.
    * Removed writeto and pwm, instead the type of a value connected to a pin
      with =: determines how the pin is driven.
    * delay now takes a value in MilliSeconds or MicroSeconds.
    * Generalized serial port interface, added support for XBee.

  arduino-copilot (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * New Copilot.Arduino.Library.Serial module.
    * Added the analog pins for Uno and Nano, and support using
      them for digital IO, when the hardware allows that to be done.
    * Support reading voltage from analog pins.
    * Support PWM.
    * Added a way to enable pullup resistors for input pins.
    * Detect if a program tries to use the same pin for both input and
      output. This is not currently supported, so it will refuse to build the
      program.
    * Copilot.Arduino.Internals API changed.

  arduino-copilot (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Move example from cabal description (where it did not render correctly)
      to README.

  arduino-copilot (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

    * First release.

description: "Arduino programming in haskell using the Copilot stream DSL\n\nSee Copilot.Arduino
  for details on how to use write a program using this\nlibrary.\n\nFor example, to
  make an Arduino blink its LED:\n\n\timport Copilot.Arduino\n\tmain = arduino $ do\n\t\tled
  =: blinking\n\t\tdelay =: constant 100\n\nThis and other examples are included in
  the examples/ directory, each\nwith their own README explaining how to build and
  use them.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome, including adding support
  for more\nArduino C libraries, provided that the C library is reasonably commonly\nused,
  and is licensed with a free software license.\n\nContributors of such libraries
  will be expected to maintain them,\notherwise they may get removed if they are blocking
  changes to\narduino-copilot or are buggy.\n\nAny contribution should have well documented
  functions and types.\n"
