synopsis: Arduino programming in haskell using the Copilot stream DSL
changelog: |
  arduino-copilot (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Bugfix: Doing the same kind of write to two different pins in the
      same program caused the C generated by Copilot to not compile.
    * Several changes making the API more FRP style, including adding
      Behavior and Event types.
    * Removed writeto and pwm, instead the type of a value connected to a pin
      with =: determines how the pin is driven.
    * delay now takes a value in MilliSeconds or MicroSeconds.
    * Generalized serial port interface, added support for XBee.

  arduino-copilot (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * New Copilot.Arduino.Library.Serial module.
    * Added the analog pins for Uno and Nano, and support using
      them for digital IO, when the hardware allows that to be done.
    * Support reading voltage from analog pins.
    * Support PWM.
    * Added a way to enable pullup resistors for input pins.
    * Detect if a program tries to use the same pin for both input and
      output. This is not currently supported, so it will refuse to build the
      program.
    * Copilot.Arduino.Internals API changed.

  arduino-copilot (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Move example from cabal description (where it did not render correctly)
      to README.

description: "Arduino programming in haskell using the Copilot stream DSL\n\nSee Copilot.Arduino
  for details on how to use write a program using this\nlibrary.\n\nFor example, to
  make an Arduino blink its LED:\n\n\timport Copilot.Arduino\n\tmain = arduino $ do\n\t\tled
  =: blinking\n\t\tdelay =: constant 100\n\nThis and other examples are included in
  the examples/ directory, each\nwith their own README explaining how to build and
  use them.\n"
