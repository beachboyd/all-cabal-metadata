description: ! "## Description\nThis is a parser for ESRI/ArcInfo (ArcGrid) files.
  These are raster GIS files\nwidely used by many geographics-related software to
  represent elevations or\nterrain features.\n\nOnly ASCII GRID (.asc) files are supported
  at the moment.\n\nIn `app/valley.asc` there is a test elevation model of a small
  valley area. It\nis parsed and printed by the `arcgrid-exe` if you do `stack exec
  arcgrid-exe`.\n\n## Usage\nThe library exports the `ArcGrid` datatype and its accessors:\n\n```
  haskell\ndata ArcGrid = ArcGrid\n               { ncols :: Int\n               ,
  nrows :: Int\n               , xllcorner :: Maybe Float\n               , yllcorner
  :: Maybe Float\n               , xllcenter :: Maybe Float\n               , yllcenter
  :: Maybe Float\n               , cellsize :: Float\n               , nodata_value
  :: Maybe Int\n               , vat :: [Int]\n               }\n```\n\nThe main interface
  for reading of grid files is `arcGridFromFile`, but the\nbytestring parser (to be
  used with Parsec) is also exported.\n\n``` haskell\narcGridFromFile :: String ->
  IO ArcGrid\n\nasciiGridParser :: Parser ArcGrid\n```\n\n## TODO:\n- unparsing\n-
  optimizations\n- support of proprietary binary formats?\n"
