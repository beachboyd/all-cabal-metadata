description: ! 'A library providing tools and various schemes for encoding arbitrary
  datatypes

  as natural numbers.  The underlying theory is that of isomorphisms with the natural

  numbers (known as Godel numbering).  The library provides functionality for defining

  multiple such encodings for a given datatype, as well as a collection of stock

  encodings and combinators which can be used to build more complex encodings.


  This has various uses, among them binary serialization/deserialization and

  enumeration testing.'
