  # arity-generic-liftA

  There's a family of functions in
  [Control.Applicative](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.0.0/docs/Control-Applicative.html)
  which follow the pattern `liftA2`, `liftA3`, etc. Using some
  tricks from Richard Eisenberg's thesis we can write them all at once. This
  package does exactly that, providing a function (`lift`) which is an
  arity-generic version of the `liftAn`.

  ```haskell
  >>> lift (\x y z -> x ++ y ++ z) (Just "a") (Just "b") (Just "c")
  Just "abc"
  ```
