description: |-
  The arXiv is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints,
  of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy,
  computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance,
  which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics,
  almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv.

  The arXiv features an API to ease access to e-prints.
  This library provides a simple and easy-to-use Haskell binding
  for the arXiv API.

  For the full documentation of the arXiv API, please refer to
  <http://arxiv.org/help/api/index>.

  More information on this haskell library,
  examples and a test suite are available
  on <https://github.com/toschoo/Haskell-Libs>.
