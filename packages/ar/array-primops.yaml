description: Boxed arrays cannot be allocated without initialization, because in that
  case the garbage collector would try to follow wild pointers. This is a source of
  inefficiency; quite a few operations must allocate a new array, initialize it, then
  overwrite the initial elements with the actually relevant data. This package provides
  low-level primitives for doing such operations without superfluous copying.
