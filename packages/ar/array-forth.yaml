description: ! 'This is a package for working with arrayForth. This is a variant of
  Forth used by GreenArrays chips. This package contains an arrayForth simulator,
  two different representations of arrayForth programs and some utilities like parsing.

  It also supports synthesizing arrayForth programs using MCMC. The basic idea is
  to find arrayForth programs by taking a simple prior distribution of programs and
  using a randomized hill-climbing algorithm to find a program fulfilling certain
  tests.'
