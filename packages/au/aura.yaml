changelog: ! "# Aura Changelog\n\n## 2.0.0\n\nThis is a large update representing
  about a month of full-time effort. Aura is now\n*much* faster, solves dependencies
  more reliably, has a few new features, and\nmany fewer bugs. This is all while modernizing
  the code and seeing a ~15% decrease\nin overall code size.\n\n### Improvements\n\n####
  Dependency Handling\n\n- Dependency resolution is now much faster and **handles
  split packages correctly**.\n  As such, the following troublesome packages now build
  correctly:\n  - `android-sdk`\n  - `backintime`\n  - `clion`\n  - `libc++`\n  -
  `mysql-connector-c++`\n  - `telegram-desktop-dev`\n  - `zoom`\n- Dependency provider
  selection for AUR packages.\n  - Example: `cron` is a legal dependency to specify,
  but there exists no package\n    with that name. `cronie` and `fcron` both \"provide\"
  `cron`, and now the user\n    can manually make a selection.\n  - Including `--noconfirm`
  will have Aura make its best guess.\n- If the exact version of an AUR package is
  available in the package cache, it\n  will be used automatically instead of being
  rebuilt. You can instead force a\n  rebuild with `--force`.\n\n#### PKGBUILD Analysis\n\n-
  In light of the recent [compromise of the Acroread package](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-general/2018-July/034151.html),\n
  \ Aura nows performs static PKGBUILD analysis before building, and warns the user
  if\n  potentially malicious terms like `curl` are found.\n  - This feature can be
  disabled with `--noanalysis`. Caveat emptor!\n  - **This feature is a supplement
  in checking PKGBUILD safety, not a fool-proof replacement.**\n    It is always your
  responsiblity to understand what build scripts are running\n    on your machine.\n\n####
  Saved Package State\n\n- `-Su` and `-Au` automatically save a package state before
  updating (unless you're doing `--dryrun`).\n  This lets you more easily roll back
  from problematic updates.\n- Saved package states can now be \"pinned\", which will
  protect them from removal via `-Bc`.\n  To pin a certain state, open its JSON file
  (see below in *Breaking Changes*) and edit the\n  `pinned` field from `false` to
  `true`.\n\n#### CLI Flags\n\n- Various CLI flag improvements:\n  - `-A --json <packages>`.
  Query the AUR directly for a package's raw JSON data. Great for debugging.\n  -
  `-Br` has been restored as short-hand for `-B --restore`.\n  - Added `-Bl` to list
  all saved package state filenames.\n  - `-Cb` added as a short-hand for `-C --backup`.\n
  \ - The Pacman flags `--ignoregroup`, `--cachedir`, `--config`, and `--logfile`
  also now affect Aura.\n  - `--dryrun` no longer requires sudo.\n  - `--color never`
  turns off all text colouring. Further, by default, Aura will\n    only automatically
  colour text when it detects that the output device is a terminal\n    (and not a
  Unix pipe, say). These behaviours match Pacman.\n\n#### Translations\n\n- Improved
  Japanese translations thanks to **Onoue Takuro**.\n- Improved Portuguese translations
  thanks to **Wagner Amaral**.\n- Improved Russian translations thanks to **Alexey
  Kotlyarov**.\n\n#### Misc.\n\n- Packages that aren't interdependent will be built
  in succession without prompting\n  the user, only calling down to `pacman` once
  per group.\n- Modernized the Haskell code:\n  - Removed custom CLI flag handling
  in favour of `optparse-applicative`.\n  - Removed custom package version number
  parsing in favour of `versions`.\n  - Removed custom text colouring code in favour
  of `prettyprinter`.\n  - Removed the `Aura` Monad in favour of Extensible Effects
  via `freer-simple`.\n  - Removed custom shell interaction code in favour of `typed-process`.\n
  \ - Used `async` to make AUR and `pacman` calls concurrent.\n  - `megaparsec` parsers
  used in place of hacky Regexes.\n- `aura` is now a library as well, and can be pulled
  into other Haskell projects.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- `-B` now saves package
  states as JSON. This makes them readable by other tools,\n  and also improves internal
  code quality. **All old package state files are no longer readable by Aura.**\n
  \ - The `\"time\"` field in these files is now a Haskell `ZonedTime`.\n- Various
  CLI flag changes:\n  - `--auradebug` is now just `--debug`, matching Pacman.\n  -
  `--aurignore` is now just `--ignore`, matching Pacman.\n  - `-Aw` has been removed.\n
  \ - `-y` no longer works with `-A`. Perform an `-Sy` ahead of time instead.\n  -
  `-O` no longer accepts arguments to adopt packages, it only displays current\n    orphans.
  Use `-O --adopt` instead for the old behaviour.\n  - `-Ccc` is now `-C --notsaved`.\n-
  Help messages (`-h`) are no longer localised.\n- Support for `powerpill` removed.\n-
  Support for `customizepkg` removed.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Aura no longer returns
  an exit code of 1 if no packages are available to upgrade.\n- `-Aq` no longer fails
  at the package installation step.\n- Ctrl+C at certain moments no longer preserves
  the Pacman lock file.\n- `makepkg` output is no longer coloured green.\n\n## 1.4.0\n-
  *Dependency resolution vastly improved.* We removed the Bash parser that used\n
  \ to poorly handle the bulk of this.\n- Chinese translations thanks to Kai Zhang.\n-
  `-M` operator and associated code fully removed.\n\n## 1.3.9\n- Updated Swedish
  translations\n- Disabled `-M` operator due to the `abs` tool being deprecated by
  Arch Linux\n\n## 1.3.8\n- Fixed behaviour of `-B` flags. For restoring of saved
  states, use the long\n  form: `aura -B --restore`. Cache backups also need to take
  their long form: `aura -C --backup`.\n- Fixed handling of language flags. Thanks
  to Doug Patti!\n\n## 1.3.5\n- Aura now uses version 5 of the `aur` package, to fix
  a critial bug\n- Updated Spanish and Polish\n\n## 1.3.4\n- Bash parser bug fix.
  Fixes some packages.\n\n## 1.3.3\n- Bash parser extended to be able to handle bash
  array expansions.\n  This enables packages with more (Bash-wise) complex PKGBUILDs
  to build\n  properly.\n\n## 1.3.2.1\n- `-Ai` and `-As` show popularity values.\n-
  `aur4` is no longer referenced.\n- `Yes/No` prompts are now localized.\n- Aura can
  be built with `stack`.\n- Updated German translation.\n\n## 1.3.1.0\n- Aura builds
  against GHC 7.10.\n- Updated German and Russian translations.\n\n## 1.3.0.4\n- Must
  use `--builduser` when building as root.\n- Bug fix regarding `--needed`.\n- Updated
  Portuguese translation.\n\n## 1.3.0.3\n- Pacman flags `--ignore` and `--ignoregroup`
  now work.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n## 1.3.0.2\n- (Bug fix) If a user tries to install a
  package in `IgnorePkg`, they\n  will now be prompted.\n- Man page updated.\n- Dependencies
  updated.\n\n## 1.3.0.1\n- (Bug fix) Tarballs are now downloaded from a URL provided
  by the RPC.\n\n## 1.3.0.0\n- Last major version of Aura 1! We have entered the design
  phase for Aura 2,\n  the implementation of which will transform Aura into a multi-distro\n
  \ package management platform.\n- Aura 1 itself has entered \"legacy\" mode. The
  only releases to be made\n  on Aura 1 after this will be of `1.3.0.x`. You'll likely
  never see\n  `1.3.1.x`.\n- Befitting a major release, we have:\n\n  - New AUR interaction
  layer via the `aur` package. This fixes nasty\n    \"AUR lookup failed\" errors.\n
  \ - `http-conduit` dropped for `wreq`, which is much easier to use.\n  - Better
  version number parsing/comparison on installation/upgrading.\n  - Package state
  backups have had their format changed. This BREAKS _all_\n    previously saved states.
  Please delete your old ones!\n  - Implemented extended `--needed` functionality
  for the AUR side of Aura.\n    AUR packages won't build if they're already installed.\n
  \ - Indonesian translations!\n  - Other updated translations.\n\n## 1.2.3.4\n- zsh
  completions completely redone (thanks to Sauyon Lee!)\n  Having `aur-git` installed
  will let you auto-complete on AUR packages.\n\n## 1.2.3.3\n- `-As --{head,tail}`
  can now be passed numbers to truncate the results\n  to any number you want. The
  default is 10.\n- Updated Russian translation.\n\n## 1.2.3.2\n- Expanded Bash completions:\n
  \   Aura Only\n      * Expanded completion for all options and search sub-options\n
  \     * Package completion for -M/--abssync\n      * Completion for orphans using
  self-generated list\n    Pacman\n      * Include completion for all pacman options\n
  \     * Directory or file completion for some common options\n- Use `--dryrun` with
  `-A` and `-M` install options to test everything\n  up until actual building would
  occur (dependency checks, etc.)\n\n## 1.2.3.1\n- Network.HTTP.Conduit errors are
  now caught properly\n  and don't crash aura.\n- `customizepkg` usage corrected.\n-
  zsh completions slightly expanded.\n\n## 1.2.3.0\n- Moved to `Network.HTTP.Conduit`
  from `Network.Curl`\n  This fixes the AUR connection issues.\n  Binary size has
  increased by quite a bit.\n\n## 1.2.2.1\n- `-Ai` now shows dependencies.\n\n## 1.2.2.0\n-
  Happy New Year!\n- makepkg's `--ignorearch` flag is now visible to Aura.\n  This
  allows users to build AUR packages on ARM devices\n  without worrying about architecture
  restrictions in PKGBUILDs.\n- Use `--head` and `--tail` to truncate `-As` results.\n-
  `-B` now uses local time.\n- Bug fixes and translation updates\n\n## 1.2.1.3\n-
  `-As` results now sort by vote. Use `--abc` to sort alphabetically.\n- \"[installed]\"
  will now be shown in `-As` results if you have it.\n- Fixed Bash parsing bug involving
  `\\\\` in arrays\n- Fixed broken `-C`\n- Updated Italian translation\n- Updated
  French translation\n\n## 1.2.1.2\n- Happy Canadian Thanksgiving\n- Bug fixes\n\n##
  1.2.1.1\n- Norwegian translation added!\n- Dependency checks slightly faster\n-
  `--hotedit` and `--custom` can now be used together\n- Bug fixes\n\n## 1.2.1.0\n-
  New `builduser` option\n- `Prelude.head` bug fixed\n- Dependency checking is faster\n-
  New `-k` output\n- `--absdeps` works properly now\n- Other bug fixes\n\n## 1.2.0.2\n-
  Bug fixes and spelling corrections.\n\n## 1.2.0.1\n- Fixes dependency build order
  bug.\n\n## 1.2.0.0\n- New operator `-M` for building ABS packages. Has its own family
  of options.\n- Pre-built binary package available (x86_64 only)\n- Updates to Aura
  are now prioritized like pacman updates.\n- Dependency checking is now faster.\n-
  Use `-Ccc` to clean the cache of only packages not saved in any package\n  record.\n-
  `-Ai` now shows Maintainer name.\n- Extensive API changes.\n\n## 1.1.6.2\n- New
  option `--no-pp`. Disables use of powerpill, even if you have it.\n- This is a light
  release, as major work is being done on version 1.2 on\n  another development branch.\n\n##
  1.1.6.1\n- Compatable with pacman 4.1\n- All pacman-color support removed\n- `-As`
  output slightly altered to match pacman.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n## 1.1.6.0\n- New option
  `--build` for specifying AUR package build path.\n- Vote number now shown in `-As`
  output.\n- Fixed Repo/AUR name collision bug.\n- API Change: Argument order for
  functions in `Aura/Languages` changed.\n\n## 1.1.5.0\n- `customizepkg` now usable

  you, Filip Brcic!\n- Fixed bug that was breaking `aura -Ss`.\n\n## 1.1.3.0\n- Changed
  `--save` and `--restore` to `-B` and `-Br`.\n  `--save` is now just an alias for
  `-B`, but `--restore`\n  must be used with `-B`.\n- New option `-Bc` for removing
  old unneeded package states.\n- `-Br` output is now sorted better and makes more
  sense.\n- Bash Parser can now properly parse `if` blocks, meaning packages\n  that
  have conditional dependencies based on architecutre will now\n  build properly.\n-

  `--hotedit` functionality altered (fix).\n- The license message is now more badass.\n\n##
  1.0.7.0\n- New libraries: Aura.Time, Aura.State\n- Moved `-C` functionality to `Aura.C`\n-
  New secret option you don't get to find out about until 1.1\n- Fixed manually alignment
  stupidity with `-Li`.\n- Bug fixes\n\n## 1.0.6.0\n- New libraries: ColourDiff, Data.Algorithm.Diff,

  New secret option you don't get to find out about until 1.1\n\n## 1.0.5.0\n- Fixed
  bug where packages with `+` in their name couldn't be\n  searched or built.\n- `-As`
  now allows multi-word searches, as it always should have.\n- `pacman-color` integration
  is more complete.\n  Still does not read the color.conf directly.\n\n## 1.0.4.0\n-
  Added French translation. Thanks to Ma Jiehong!\n- Added Russian translation. Thanks
  to Kyrylo Silin!\n- Fixed bug where packages with dots in their name wouldn't build.\n\n##
  1.0.3.2\n- Moved haskell dependencies out of `makedepends` field and into\n  `depends`
  field in PKGBUILD. Makedepends can usually be ignored\n  after building, but haskell
  packages are a pain to rebuild\n  and reregister at every build. It's more realistic
  to just keep\n  them installed. This is what other haskell packages in the AUR\n
  \ do as well.\n- Fixed pacman-color issues.\n\n## 1.0.3.1\n- Added `--auradebug`
  option.\n\n## 1.0.3.0\n- Compatibility with AUR 2.0 added.\n- Portuguese translation
  added. Thanks to Henry \"Ingvij\" Kupty!\n- Support for `pacman-color` added. Run
  sudo with `-E` a la:\n    sudo -E aura -Ayu\n- Fixed backslash parsing bug in `Bash`.\n\n##
  1.0.2.2\n- Fixed parsing bug in `Bash`.\n  If one package fell victim, a whole `-Au`
  session would fail.\n\n## 1.0.2.1\n- Added License info to source files.\n- Fixed
  virtual package recognition bug.\n- Altered version conflict error message.\n- Fixed
  bug in Bash parser that would occasionally break parsing.\n\n## 1.0.2.0\n- Bug fixes.\n-
  Extended the Bash parser. PKGBUILDs that had bash variables in their\n  dependency
  arrays will now be parsed correctly.\n\n## 1.0.1.0\n- German translation (use with
  --german).\n  Thanks to Lukas Niederbremer!\n- Spanish translation (use with --spanish)\n
  \ Thanks to Alejandro Gómez!\n- Replaced regex-posix with regex-pcre.\n- `-As` now
  highlights properly.\n- Moved a number of modules to `Aura/`\n\n## 1.0.0.0\n- Fixed
  `-V` message in terminals other than urxvt.\n- New `haskell-ansi-terminal` library
  to do this.\n\n## 0.10.0.0\n- Internet access moved to Network.Curl library.\n-
  `Bash.hs` library created to help with PKGBUILD parsing.\n  Can currently handle
  string expansions a la::\n\n    \"this-is-{awesome,neat}\" => [\"this-is-awesome\",\"this-is-neat\"]\n\n##
  0.9.2.3\n- Dependency determining speed up.\n- Added AUR URL to `-Ai`.\n\n## 0.9.3.2\n-
  Swedish translation.\n  Thanks to Fredrik Haikarainen!\n\n## 0.9.2.0\n- `-Ai` and
  `-As`!\n\n## 0.9.1.0\n- `-Au` is about 20 times faster.\n\n## 0.9.?.?\n- Polish
  translation.\n  Thanks to Chris \"Kwpolska\" Warrick!\n- Croatian translation.\n
  \ Thanks to Denis Kasak!\n\n## 0.9.0.0\n- New `-O` operation for dealing with orphan
  packages.\n- A man page!\n\n## 0.8.0.0\n- Help message now supports multiple languages.\n-
  Broke \"no overlapping options\" convention.\n- `-Cz` is now `-Cb`.\n- New option
  `-Ad`. Lists _all_ dependencies of an AUR package.\n  This is to aid pre-building
  research.\n  This option shows information you can't get from looking at PKGBUILDS!\n\n##
  0.7.3.0\n- New option `--conf`. Lets you quickly view your pacman.conf.\n\n## 0.7.2.3\n-
  `--log` is now `-L`.\n- New option `-Ls`. Search the log file via a regex.\n- New
  option `-Li`. Reports information on a given package that has had\n  any appearance
  in the log file.\n\n## 0.7.0.0\n- `--hotedit` option added.\n- `Shell` library added.\n\n##
  0.6.0.0\n- Aura passes proper exit codes to the shell upon completion.\n"

description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aurapm/aura.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aurapm/aura)\n[![Join
  the chat at https://gitter.im/aurapm/aura](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/aurapm/aura?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n#
  What is Aura?\nAura is a package manager for Arch Linux. It's main purpose is as
  an\n\"AUR helper\", in that it automates the process of installating packages\nfrom
  the Arch User Repositories. It is, however, capable of much more.\n\n# The Aura
  Philosophy\n\n### Aura is Pacman\n  Aura doesn't just mimic pacman... it _is_ pacman.\n
  \ All pacman operations and their sub-options are allowed.\n  Some even hold special
  meaning in Aura as well.\n\n### Arch is Arch. AUR is AUR.\n  `-S` yields pacman
  packages and _only_ pacman packages. This agrees with\n  the above. Thus in Aura,
  the `-A` operation is introduced for obtaining\n  AUR packages. `-A` comes with
  sub-options you're used to (`-u`, `-s`,\n  `-i`, etc.).\n\n### All together\nDependencies
  and packages are not built and installed one at a time.\nInstall order is as follows:\n1.
  All pacman dependencies (all at once).\n2. All AUR dependencies (one at a time).\n3.
  All AUR packages (all at once).\n\n### Quiet Building\n  By default `makepkg` output
  is suppressed. If you want the people\n  behind you to think you're a badass hacker,
  then this suppression\n  can be disabled by using `-x` alongside `-A`.\n\n### Run
  as Root, Build as a User\n  `makepkg` gets very upset if you try to build a package
  as root.\n  That said, a built package can't be handed off to pacman and installed\n
  \ if you _don't_ run as root. Other AUR helpers ignore this problem,\n  but Aura
  does not. Even when run with `sudo`, packages are built\n  with normal user privileges,
  then handed to pacman and installed as root.\n\n### Know your System\n  Editing
  PKGBUILDs mid-build is not default behaviour.\n  An Arch user should know _exactly_
  what they're putting into their system,\n  thus research into prospective packages
  should be done beforehand.\n  However, for functionality's sake, the option `--hotedit`
  used with `-A`\n  will prompt the user for PKGBUILD editing. Regardless, as a responsible\n
  \ user you must know what you are building.\n\n### Downgradibility\n  Built AUR
  package files are moved to the package cache.\n  This allows for them to be easily
  downgraded when problems arise.\n  Other top AUR helper programs do not do this.\n
  \ The option `-B` will save a package state, and `-Br` will restore\n  a state you
  select. `-Au` also automatically invokes a save,\n  to help you roll back from problematic
  updates.\n\n### No Orphans\n  Sometimes dependencies lose their *required* status,
  but remain\n  installed on your system. Sometimes AUR package \"makedepends\"\n
  \ aren't required at all after install. Packages like this just\n  sit there, receiving
  upgrades for no reason.\n  Aura helps keep track of and remove packages like this.\n
  \ Learn more [here](#working-with-orphan-packages).\n\n### Arch Linux for Everyone\n
  \ English is well established as the world's Lingua Franca, and is also\n  the dominant
  language of computing and the internet. That said, it's\n  natural that some people
  are going to be more comfortable working\n  in their native language. From the beginning
  Aura has been built with\n  multiple-language support in mind, making it very easy
  to add new ones.\n\n### Haskell\n  Aura is written in Haskell, which means easy
  development and pretty code.\n  Please feel free to use it as a simple Haskell reference.\n
  \ Aura code demonstrates:\n  * Parser Combinators (`megaparsec`)\n  * CLI Flag Handling
  (`optparse-applicative`)\n  * Extensible Effects (`freer-simple`)\n  * Concurrency
  (`async`)\n  * Shell Interaction (`shelly`)\n\n# Installation\n\n## Arch Linux\n\nIt
  is recommended to install the prebuilt binary of Aura:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aura-bin.git\ncd
  aura-bin\nmakepkg\nsudo pacman -U <the-package-file-that-makepkg-produces>\n```\n\n##
  Manual\n\nYou will need the [stack tool](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
  for Haskell\nto compile Aura yourself. Then:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/aurapm/aura.git\ncd
  aura\nstack install -- aura\n```\n\nThis may take a while to initially build all
  of Aura's dependencies. Once complete,\nyour `aura` binary will be available in
  `~/.local/bin/`.\n\nSample Usage\n============\n\n#### Installing Packages\nInstall
  an AUR package:\n\n    aura -A (package)\n\nAuthor's favourite (upgrades, removes
  make deps, shows PKGBUILD diffs):\n\n    aura -Akuax\n\nJust upgrade all installed
  AUR packages:\n\n    aura -Au\n\nLook up information on an AUR package:\n\n    aura
  -Ai (package)\n\nSearch the AUR via a regex:\n\n    aura -As (regex)\n\nDisplay
  an AUR package's PKGBUILD:\n\n    aura -Ap (package)\n\nDisplay an AUR package's
  dependencies (and those deps' deps too):\n\n    aura -Ad (package)\n\nInstall with
  makepkg output unsuppressed:\n\n    aura -Ax (package)\n\nInstall and remove make
  dependencies afterwards:\n\n    aura -Aa (package)\n\nInstall and show PKGBUILD
  differences:\n\n    aura -Ak (package)\n\n#### Working with Package Records\nStore
  a record of all installed packages:\n\n    aura -B\n\nRestore a saved record. Rolls
  back, uninstalls, and reinstalls packages as necessary:\n\n    aura -Br\n\n####
  Working with the Package Cache\nDowngrade a package (this is interactive):\n\n    aura
  -C (package)\n\nSearch the package cache for package files via a regex:\n\n    aura
  -Cs (regex)\n\nBackup the package cache:\n\n    aura -Cb (/path/to/backup/location/)\n\nReduce
  the package cache to contain only 'x' of each package file:\n\n    aura -Cc x\n\n####
  Working with the Pacman Log\nView the Pacman Log:\n\n    aura -L\n\nDisplay install
  / upgrade history for a package:\n\n    aura -Li (package)\n\nSearch the pacman
  logfile via a regex:\n\n    aura -Ls (regex)\n\n#### Working with Orphan Packages\nDisplay
  orphan packages:\n\n    aura -O\n\nAdopt an orphan package:\n\n    aura -O --adopt
  (package)\n\nUninstall all orphan packages:\n\n    aura -Oj\n\nMore information
  is available in aura's manpage.\n\n# Localisation\nAs mentioned in the Philosophy
  above, adding new languages to Aura is\nquite easy. If you speak a language other
  than those available and\nwould like it added to Aura, please consult **LOCALISATION.md**.\n\nAura
