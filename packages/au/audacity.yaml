description: ! 'This package provides functions

  for interchange with the Audacity sound signal editor.

  Currently we support import and export of label tracks,

  export of Audacity projects and

  limited import of tracks from Audacity projects.


  We provide some examples that are useful on its own:


  * @sox-split@:

  Split an audio file according to a label track.

  Audacity provides this function by itself.

  You can use placeholders like @%s@ and @%02d@

  in order to compose the names of the parts from the labels and positions.


  * @sox-concat@:

  Concatenate a sequence of sound files with matching

  sampling rates and numbers of channels using SoX

  and generate an Audacity label track file

  that shows the origins of the parts.


  * @audacity-concat@:

  Create an Audacity project file

  containing a virtual concatenation of the input sound files

  and a label track showing the origins of the sound files.


  * @audacity-combine@:

  Put several audio and label files into tracks of a new Audacity project.

  Opening one or even multiple such projects is much easier

  than loading individual tracks into Audacity.'
