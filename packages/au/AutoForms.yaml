description: ! 'IMPORTANT! Development of AutoForms has stopped. In stead use

  WxGeneric (see

  http://lindstroem.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/introducing-wxgeneric/ )

  which is based upon AutoForms. Nonetheless, AutoForms may still a good

  resource for ideas.


  AutoForms is a library to ease the creation of Graphical User

  Interfaces (GUI). It does this by using generic programming to

  construct GUI components.


  The AutoForms user creates an ordinary algebraic data type (ADT),

  which should reflect the data model of an application. From this ADT

  AutoForms automatically constructs a GUI component, by using the

  structure and identifiers of the ADT. To facilitate this construction,

  AutoForms uses the ''Scrap your boilerplate'' approach to generic

  programming.


  This component can be displayed using WxHaskell or by an AutoForms

  custom monad called WxM.. The first facilitates that people who

  already knows WxHaskell quickly will be able to make GUIs. The second

  is our attempt at a more type-safe and easier to use GUI toolkit.'
