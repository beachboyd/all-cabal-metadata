description: ! 'Mudbath is continuous deployment server which integrates with GitHub.
  It

  listens for deployment events and when it receives one, executes a shell

  script. It reports progress back to GitHub in the form of deployment

  status updates.

  Mudbath can also send notifications to Slack if the proper keys are

  provided. Other notification sinks can be easily added if needed.'
