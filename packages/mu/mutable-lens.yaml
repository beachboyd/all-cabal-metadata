description: |-
  Use mutable references as lens, compose them with other lens, and run them.

  You may have heard of lens being described as "functional" or "first-class"
  references, with some nice properties such as composition. However the
  equivalence is more than just abstract - mutable references can be readily
  converted into lens form, interoperable with other pure lens. This makes use
  of the fact that "mutability" in a high-level language focusing on purity, is
  really just an alias for a pure state monad that is treated specially by the
  runtime system. A mutable reference over a value of type @a@ with world state
  of type @s@, *is* therefore an actual @Lens s s a a@. There is no need for
  handwaving or connotative language, the isomorphism is direct and concrete.

  This package demonstrates this isomorphism, converting between the two forms.
  You then have access to the whole of the lens ecosystem and its compositional
  properties, and use them with mutable references without other special-cased
  shims or mutable-specific abstractions.

  Uniformity of API is another major benefit - if you want to switch to a
  different reference type, you only have to change your type definitions and
  imports, you don't have to change all @readSomeVar@ to @readOtherVar@,
  @writeSomeVar@ to @writeOtherVar@, or was it @putOtherVar@, and does the
  @atomicModifyVar@ function take a @s -> (a, s)@ or a @s -> (s, a)@ again?

  On the other hand, this package has not been optimised for performance, and
  currently only supports GHC. We would certainly welcome contributions in
  these areas, if you are interested in running this code in production. Until
  that happens, please be cautious and treat this code as experimental.

  For what it's worth, the API is likely to be very stable: an isomorphism to
  another well-established library, is not a complex API.
