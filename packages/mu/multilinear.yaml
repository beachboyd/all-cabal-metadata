  Summary\r\nMultilinear is general - purpose linear algebra and multi-dimensional
  array library for Haskell. It provides generic and efficient implementation of linear
  algebra operations on vectors, linear functionals, matrices and its higher - rank
  analoges: tensors. It can also be used as simply a miltidimensional arrays for everyone.
  \r\n\r\n### AS FOR NOW, THE LIBRARY IS IN BETA PHASE  - DO NOT USE IT FOR PRODUCTION!!\r\n\r\n##
  Scripting\r\n\r\nMultilinear is optimized to being used from GHCi. It uses easy
  and concise notation of Einstein summation convention to calculate complex tasks.
  Using this, you are able to write for example a deep learnin neural network from
  scratch in just a few lines of interpreter code. If you want to know more about
  Einstein convention, see the Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation\r\n\r\n##
  Machine learning\r\n\r\nMulti-dimensional algebra is especially useful to quickly
  write machine learning algorithms (eg. neural networks) from scratch. When library
  will be stable, some examples will be available. \r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nIf
  you want to contribute to this library, contact with me. \r\n\r\n## Who do I talk
