  =======


  What''s this?

  ------------


  Azurify is an incomplete yet sort-of-functional library and command line client
  to access the Azure Blob Storage API [1]


  The following features are implemented:

  - Creating and deleting containers

  - Listing the contents of a container

  - Downloading blobs

  - Uploading a new block blob

  - Uploading page blobs

  - Deleting a blob

  - Breaking a blob lease


  The following features are *not* implemented (yet):

  - Doing anything else with leases

  - Anything with snapshots

  - Proper error handling


  How do I use this?

  ------------------


  The cabal file will build a binary called ``azurify``. The following commands are
  supported:


  - ``azurify uploadblob path/to/file accountname containername blobname``: to upload
  the local file ``path/to/file`` to the specified location;

  - ``azurify downloadblob accountname containername blobname``: to download the specified
  blob the the current directory;

  - ``azurify deleteblob accountname containername blobname``: to delete the specified
  blob;

  - ``azurify breakbloblease accountname containername blobname``: to break the lease
  on the specified blob;

  - ``azurify listcontainer accountname containername``: to output a list of blobs
  in the specified container;

  - ``azurify createcontainer accountname containername [accesscontrol]``: accesscontrol
  may be either blobpublic, containerpublic or private. blobpublic means that the
  blobs will be downloadable by everyone, but the container can''t be listed without
  an access key. containerpublic means that all blobs are downloadable by everyone
  and that everyone can list the container. private means that the access key is required
  to download blobs or list the container;

  - ``azurify deletecontainer accountname containername``: delete the container with
  the given name. It will fail if the container is non-empty, if you want to delete
  it anyway use ``--force``.


  You can also use the library in your Haskell applications, all you need are the
  functions exported in the ``azure.hs`` file.


  Can I use this?

  ---------------


  Azurify is BSD licensed (see LICENSE) so yes, you can use it.
