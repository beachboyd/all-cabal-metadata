description: ! 'Some operations on n-ary tuples, including ''uncons'', ''cons'', etc.
  This package distinguish itself from other packages

  on tuple mainly on the the implementation under the cover. It converts Generic datatype
  into the its representation

  form, and carries out the operations on there.  The other point is that this package
  tends to treat non-tuples directly as

  1-ary, without need of ''OneTuple'' or similar intermediate wrapper.'
