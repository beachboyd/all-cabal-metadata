description: ! "The Cabal library package\n=========================\n\nInstallation
  instructions for the DSTM library\n===============================================\n\nInstalling
  as a user (no root or administer access)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n
  \   ghc --make Setup\n    ./Setup configure --user\n    ./Setup build\n    ./Setup
  install\n\nNote the use of the `--user` flag at the configure step.\n\nCompiling
  Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and works on\nWindows. For
  all packages other than Cabal itself it is fine to use `runghc`.\n\nThis will install
  into `$HOME/.cabal/` on unix and into\n`$Documents and Settings\\$User\\Application
  Data\\cabal\\` on Windows\nIf you want to install elsewhere use the `--prefix=`
  flag at the\nconfigure step.\n\n\nInstalling as root / Administrator\n----------------------------------\n\n
  \   ghc --make Setup\n    ./Setup configure\n    ./Setup build\n    sudo ./Setup
  install\n\nCompiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and works
  on\nWindows. For all packages other than Cabal itself it is fine to use `runghc`.\n\nThis
  will install into `/usr/local` on unix and on Windows it will\ninstall into `$ProgramFiles/Haskell`.
  If you want to install\nelsewhere use the `--prefix=` flag at the configure step.\n\nUserï¿½s
  Manual\n==============\nPlease see DSTMManual.pdf in the DSTM directory.\n\nBugs\n=======\n\nPlease
  report bugs and wish-list items to:\n\nfrk@informatik.uni-kiel.de\n\n\nYour Help\n---------\n\nTo
  help us in the next round of development work it would be\nenormously helpful to
  know from our users what their user experience is.\n"
