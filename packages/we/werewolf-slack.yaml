  Status](https://travis-ci.org/hjwylde/werewolf-slack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hjwylde/werewolf-slack)\n[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/hjwylde/werewolf-slack.svg)](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf-slack/releases/latest)\n[![werewolf-slack
  on Stackage LTS](https://www.stackage.org/package/werewolf-slack/badge/lts)](https://www.stackage.org/lts/package/werewolf-slack)\n[![werewolf-slack
  on Stackage Nightly](https://www.stackage.org/package/werewolf-slack/badge/nightly)](https://www.stackage.org/nightly/package/werewolf-slack)\n\nA
  chat interface for playing [werewolf](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf) in\n
  \   [Slack](https://slack.com/).\nWerewolf is a well known social party game, commonly
  also called Mafia.\nSee the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))
  for a rundown on its\n    gameplay and history.\n\n![Werewolf for Slack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hjwylde/werewolf-slack/master/.readme/werewolf-for-slack.png)\n\n###
  Game description\n\nLong has the woods been home to wild creatures, both kind and
  cruel.\nMost have faces and are known to the inhabitants of FougÃ¨res in Brittany,
  France; but no-one from\n    the village has yet to lay eyes on the merciless Werewolf.\n\nEach
  night Werewolves attack the village and devour the innocent.\nFor centuries no-one
  knew how to fight this scourge, however recently a theory has taken ahold that\n
  \   mayhaps the Werewolves walk among the Villagers themselves...\n\nObjective of
  the game:  \nFor the Loners: complete their own objective.  \nFor the Villagers:
  lynch all of the Werewolves.  \nFor the Werewolves: devour all of the Villagers.\n\n###
  Setup\n\n#### Preparing Slack\n\nSet up an Incoming Webhook [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/).\nMake
  note of the *webhook url*, we'll be using that soon.\n\nSet up a Slash Command (`/werewolf`
  or similar)\n    [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands/).\nThe
  Slash Command should perform a GET request to the server werewolf-slack is going
  to be hosted\n    on.\nMake note of the *token* here too.\n\n#### Installing\n\nInstalling
  werewolf-slack is easiest done using either\n    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  (recommended),\n    [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) or\n    [Cabal](https://github.com/haskell/cabal).\n\n**Using
  Docker:**\n\n```bash\ndocker pull hjwylde/werewolf-slack-docker\n```\n\n**Using
  stack:**\n\n```bash\nstack install werewolf-slack werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin\n```\n\n**Using
  Cabal:**\n\n```bash\ncabal-install werewolf-slack werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin\n```\n\n####
  Running\n\nwerewolf-slack is a simple web server that listens for events from the
  Slack Slash Command.\nAfter receiving an event werewolf-slack forwards it on to
  the werewolf game engine and uses the\n    Incoming Webhook to send back the response.\n\nRunning
  werewolf-slack is easiest done using either\n    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  (recommended) or\n    the binary itself.\nMake sure to add rules to your firewall
  for werewolf-slack's port.\n\n**With Docker:**\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 80:80
  hjwylde/werewolf-slack-docker -v TOKEN -u WEBHOOK_URL\n```\n\n**With werewolf-slack:**\n\n```bash\nwerewolf-slack
  -v TOKEN -u WEBHOOK_URL &\n```\n\n#### Configuration\n\nIt is possible to also configure
  the port that werewolf-slack listens on. This is done via the\n    `--port` (`-p`)
  option.\n\nThe default port is *80*.\n\n### Usage\n\nType `/werewolf help` in your
  Slack channel to get going!\n"
