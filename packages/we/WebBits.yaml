description: ! 'WebBits is a collection of libraries for working with JavaScript,
  contains a parser, a pretty-printer and a lexical environment analyser. The original
  author of the package is the PLT group of Brown University (http:\/\/www.cs.brown.edu\/research\/plt\/).
  Changes since version 2.1: the syntax of the try-catch-finally statement has been
  changed in accordance to the ECMAScript specification -- now it only has at most
  one catch clause. The original test-suite needs updating to support the current
  test system: patches are welcome.'
