  # Revision history for WEditor

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2020-04-17

  * **[breaking]** Adds line-splitting to `FixedFontParser` requirements. This
    ensures that a custom parser that formats the front of the line (e.g., adding
    block indentation) works properly when paragraph breaks are inserted. This
    does not affect compilation or behavior of code that isn't using custom
    line-wrapping policies.

  * **[breaking]** Adds vertical shifting of the viewable text area. This only
    affects compilation of custom `FixedFontViewer`, and otherwise extends the
    available functionality of existing code.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2020-04-14

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  This package contains interfaces and implementations of text-editing idioms
  that can be wired up to UI libraries to create a text-editor widget.

  The goal is to provide:

  * Dynamic line wrapping that preserves the cursor and edit positions.
  * Customizable line-wrapping policies and word-hyphenation policies.
  * Automatic management of a dynamically-sized viewable area.
  * Support for novel character types.

  Also see @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/WEditorHyphen WEditorHyphen>@
  for  language-specific hyphenation rules.
