description: ! 'JuPyTer notebook parser

  =======================

  [JuPyTer](https://jupyter.org/) was formerly called IPython notebook.


  It is cross-language interactive data science platform

  that allows for interactive editing of code and visualizing its results.


  This library allows to directly parse `.ipynb` files, and process them.


  There is an example script `jupyter-extract` that just extracts

  all the source code cells, and prints them.


  Initial version was generated with [`json-autotype`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-autotype)
