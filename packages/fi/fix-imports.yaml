synopsis: Program to manage the imports of a haskell module
changelog: ! '1.1.0


  - Rename import-order to import-order-first, and add import-order-last.


  1.0.5


  - support haskell-src-exts > 1.16


  - add ''language'' field to .fix-imports, to turn on local extensions


  1.0.3 and 1.0.4


  - upgrade to haskell-src-exts-1.16


  1.0.2


  - Fix bug where a qualified import with >1 dot wasn''t found.  And don''t

  mess with Prelude.


  1.0.1


  - Fix a bunch of bugs: properly recognize unqualified imports as imports,

  never import the current module, don''t pick up modules with the same suffix

  but a different name.


  1.0.0


  - Change name from FixImports to fix-imports, which is more unixy.


  - Change ghc-pkg parsing from String to Text.  It''s noticeably faster.


  - Add a more flexible system for prioritizing imports.

  When there are several possibilities for a module name, they are all given

  to a single function to decide.  The config file moved from

  fix-imports-priority to .fix-imports and can now specify sort orders for

  packages and modules by prefix.


  - Make -i includes for non-existent dirs ignored instead of causing an

  error.

description: ! 'There are a few things which can be configured.  Edit src/Main.hs
  and mess with

  the Config it passes in.  There isn''t much configurability but what there is

  should be documented in the modules in which it is defined.


  See the vimrc for an exmaple of how it can be bound to a key in vim.


  It''ll reformat the import lines, including an import list if you have one.

  Sorry about that.  The formatting style of Language.Haskell.Exts.prettyPrint

  is not my personal style.  If it ever bothers me enough maybe I''ll write my

  own formatter, or come up with a way to not reformat unqualified imports.


  Also, it will search for modules starting from ''.'', so you should be in the

  root of the module hierarchy.  It wouldn''t be hard to add a -i flag though.


  haskell-src-exts will crash the program if it gets an ambigious operator

  fixity parse.  I don''t know why it does that, but if you get a crash like that

  you can add your custom operators to the Config.


  It can be a little slow.  Most of the time is haskell-src-exts parsing the

  module.
