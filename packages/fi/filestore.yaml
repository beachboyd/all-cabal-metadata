synopsis: Interface for versioning file stores.
changelog: ! "Version 0.6.3.3 released 14 May 2018\n\n* Use build-type Simple (hvr).\n\nVersion
  0.6.3.2 released 10 Apr 2018\n\n* Update version bounds for dependencies.\n* Tweaked
  tests.  We no longer run darcs tests; they seem to\n  depend too much on the details
  of the system and the darcs\n  version.\n\nVersion 0.6.3.1 released 13 Feb 2017\n\n*
  Bump to 0.6.3.1, raise directory upper bound.\n* Fix false-positive on travis.\n*
  Fix bug in 'revision' for git (changes were not obtained).\n\nVersion 0.6.3 released
  23 Jan 2017\n\n* Handle git rename changes (as a Deleted+Added) (#10, Kevin Quick).\n\nVersion
  0.6.2 released 13 Jun 2016\n\n* Set committer name and email when committing (#19,
  Phil Ruffwind).\n\n* Fixes for compatibility with ghc 8 (Sergei Trofimovich).\n\nVersion
  0.6.1 released 27 July 2015\n\n* Create `.git/hooks` directory if missing on initialize\n
  \ (jgm/gitit#505).\n\n* Set git username, email.\n\n* Added preliminary symlink
  handling (Jeffrey David Johnson).\n\nVersion 0.6.0.6 released 2 April 2015\n\n*
  Added compatibility module Data.FileStore.Compat.Locale\n  so that filestore will
  compile against time 1.5.\n\nVersion 0.6.0.5 released 2 April 2015\n\n* Mark post-update
  as a bash script (not a generic shell script).\n\n* Bump version bounds for dependencies.\n\nVersion
  0.6.0.4 released 31 Oct 2014\n\n* Fixed test suite so that it returns error status
  if tests fail (#16).\n\nVersion 0.6.0.3 released 26 Jul 2014\n\n* Disable the broken
  mercurial command server on Windows, falling back\n  on direct running of each command
  (Alan Brooks).\n\n* Added a script demonstrating use of filestore to query darcs
  repositories\n  (gwern).\n\nVersion 0.6.0.2 released 08 Apr 2014\n\n* Bumped version
  for process so it will compile with GHC 7.8.1.\n\nVersion 0.6.0.1 released 20 Mar
  2013\n\n* runProcess now allows access to the current environment, instead of\n
  \ running in a bare environment.  This fixes problems for those who have\n  git
  in a nonstandard path. (Jochen Keil)\n\n* Allow latest Diff.\n\n* Reconfigured cabal
  file to use new Cabal test framework.  Run tests with\n  `cabal configure --enable-tests
  && cabal build &&  cabal test`.\n\n* Set environment variable HGENCODING for mercurial.
  \ Closes #6.\n\nVersion 0.6 released 31 Dec 2012\n\n* Updated to use Diff 0.2.  This
  involves an API change:\n  diff now returns [Diff [String]] rather than [(DI, String)].\n
  \ Thanks to markwright for the patch.\n\n* Test revDescription more thoroughly (Ben
  Millwood).\n\n* Fixed error handling in withVerifyDir.\n\nVersion 0.5.0.1 released
  21 Oct 2012\n\n* Bumped version limits on dependencies.\n\n* Upgraded Utils to use
  Control.Exception.\n\nVersion 0.5 released 30 Apr 2012\n\n* Added 'limit' parameter
  to 'history', so that in large repositories\n  you don't need to generate and parse
  the entire log.\n\n* Revised the git log parser, so it is faster and lazy.  This
  is\n  helpful for applications where we may not need to parse the whole\n  history.
  \ It would be good to make similar modifications to the hg\n  and darcs log parsers
  in the future.\n\nVersion 0.3.4.3 released 26 Sep 2010\n\n* runShellCommand: reverted
  to older version with temp files.\n  The new version caused lazy-IO related problems
  with large\n  files. Thanks to Pavel Perikov diagnosing the problem.\n\nVersion
  0.3.4.2 released 03 Aug 2010\n\n* gitInit:  Set up repository to allow push to the
  current\n  branch.  This is needed for recent versions of git,\n  which don't allow
  a push to the master branch.  Resolves\n  Issue #104.\n\n* New version of runShellCommand
  that does not require\n  temp files, using runInteractiveProcess.\n\n* Suppress
  \"unused do bind\" warnings in build.\n\nVersion 0.3.4.1 released 22 Jan 2010\n\n*
  Rewrote splitEmailAuthor with list fns not regexes.\n  Also removed regex-posix
  from cabal build-depends.\n\n* Corrected error message for richDirectory\n\n* Improved
  git search:\n  + Previously git search would fail in some cases, with an error\n
  \   in parseMatchLine (for example, with unicode search term).\n  + We replaced
  the regex with a simpler match-line parser using\n    Preface functions.\n  + We
  also now use --null to force a NUL separator in git grep.\n  + The test case that
  previously failed now passes.\n\nVersion 0.3.4 released 10 Dec 2009\n\n* Added Mercurial
  module and associated tests.\n  Thanks to John Lenz for the patch.\n\n* Added test
  case for nonascii directory name\n\n* gitLatestRevId - added check to make sure
  resource hasn't been removed.\n  Without this, you get a ResourceExists error when
  creating a file\n  that has been previously deleted from the repo.\n\n* Use -z with
  git ls-tree.  This resolves Issue #77.\n  When 'git ls-tree' is used with -z, it
  prints regular UTF8 instead of\n  octal encoding it. So we can avoid the problem
  we were having with\n  filenames like Foo\\230\\331/Bar.\n\n* Use -z for 'git whatchanged'.
  This allows us to remove the kludgy\n  'convertEncoded' function, which parsed encoded
  filenames.\n\nVersion 0.3.3.1 released 22 Nov 2009\n\n* Raise an IllegalResourceName
  error if the user tries to\n  delete a file inside .git or _darcs subdirectory.\n\n*
  Have gitSearch return no matches, instead of raising an error,\n  if error status
  = 1.  Recent versions of git-grep return 1 if\n  no matches found.\n\n* Fix git
  log parsing so that it allows log comments to start with ':'\n  Thanks to thorben
  for uncovering the bug.\n\nVersion 0.3.3 released 06 Nov 2009\n\n* isInsideDir is
  again exported.\n\nVersion 0.3.2.2 released 06 Nov 2009\n\n* Raise an IllegalResourceName
  error if the user tries to create\n  a file inside the .git or _darcs subdirectory.
  \ Previously the\n  file would be written (or overwritten) before the error was
  caught\n  in the add/commit phase.  This introduced the risk of corrupting\n  the
  repository or, worse, overwriting hooks.\n\n* isInsideDir is no longer exported.\n\n*
  checkAndWriteFile has been replaced with withSanityCheck, to avoid\n  code duplication
  between create and rename functions.\n\nVersion 0.3.2.1 released 24 Oct 2009\n\n*
  Convert pathname to UTF8 in withVerifyDir.\n\nVersion 0.3.2 released 22 Aug 2009\n\n*
  Made maxcount default to True, as '--max-count' is supported by\n  the latest released
  version of darcs (2.3.0). Print an informative\n  error message if the version of
  darcs being used does not support\n  --max-count.\n\n* Made 'initialize' throw RepoExists
  error only if the repo\n  exists; catch permission or other errors separately. (Thomas
  Hartmann)\n\n* Made 'index' throw an error if the directory is not present or\n
  \ there are insufficient permissions.  (Thomas Hartmann)\n\n* Improved error message
  for search match helper.\n\nVersion 0.3.1 released 04 Jul 2009\n\n* Added -I flag
  to grep in regSearchFiles. Ignore binary files\n  in the repository when searching.\n\n*
  Added maxcount Cabal flag, defaulting to False.  When true,\n  this flag causes
  'latest' to run 'darcs changes' with the\n  flag '--max-count=1', which dramatically
  increases performance.\n  (Without this, filestore has to retrieve the entire changelog\n
  \ just to get the latest revision ID.) '--max-count' is at this\n  point only in
  development versions of darcs.\n\n* Removed quoting from --match=hash in Darcs module
  (since it doesn't\n  go through /bin/sh).  Thanks to Ganesh Sittampalam.\n\n* Efficiency
  improvements and refactoring in Darcs module.\n\n* Moved darcs utility functions
  to Util module.\n\nVersion 0.3 released 08 Apr 2009\n\n* Added new 'directory' function,
  which returns a list of resources given\n  a directory name. Resources are marked
  as either FSFile or\n  FSDirectory. Thanks to Thomas Hartman for showing the need
  for\n  'directory', and for distinguishing explicitly between files and\n  directories.
  In 'index' the distinction was previously left implicit,\n  which worked for git
  but not darcs: 'index' provided no way of\n  distinguishing an empty directory from
  a file.\n\n* In 'directory' and 'index', git ls-tree is used instead of git ls-files;\n
  \ this guarantees that only files that have been committed are returned.\n  'index'
  now lists only files, and no longer includes empty directories\n  even in darcs.\n\n*
  Added new richDirectory function to Data.FileStore.Generic.\n  richDirectory returns
  a directory that includes information\n  about the latest revision of each file.
  Thanks to Thomas Hartman for\n  the patch.\n\n* Replaced ResourceName type with
  FilePath.\n\n* Added repository information to cabal file.\n\nVersion 0.2 released
  08 Feb 2009\n\n* Changed diff to do a line-by-line rather than word-by-word diff.\n
  \ The word-by-word diff led to excessive memory usage and confusing\n  output in
  some cases.  NOTE:  diff now returns lists of lines,\n  not including newlines.
  \ So calling programs may need to be changed.\n\n  diff also now skips calling getGroupedDiff
  when the left document\n  is empty, for better performance.\n\n* Added ghc-prof-options
  to cabal file.\n\n* Clean up code in gitRetrieve.\n\n* Added ensureFileExists to
  Darcs module. Added checks to ensure that file\n  exists in darcsLatestRevId and
  darcsRetrieve.  If not, return\n  NotFound.\n\n* gitRetrieve:  check to make sure
  object is a file before retrieving.\n  Also, if Nothing is the revision ID, use
  gitLatestRevId rather than\n  going directly to the file system. This is a step
  in the direction of\n  making filestore compatible with bare repositories.\n\n*
  Test suite has been wired into Setup.lhs:  'cabal test' now runs tests.\n\n* Added
  new test case for attempting to retrieve a subdirectory,\n  and for creating a second
  file in a subdirectory.\n\n* Minor code cleanup.\n\n* Added CHANGES.\n\nVersion
  0.1 released 24 Jan 2009\n\n* Initial release.\n"
