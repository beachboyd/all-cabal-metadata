synopsis: Signed 15.16 precision fixed point arithmetic
changelog: |+
  0.3
  ---
  * Fixed an outstanding bug in round.

  0.2.1.1
  -------
  * Minor documentation improvements.
  * Require `base >= 4.7` properly in the source repository as the implementation uses `coerce`, so it doesn't work on GHC < 7.8.
    This was fixed by maintenance releases to hackage previously.

  0.2.1
  -----
  * Fixed bug in `signum`

  0.2
  ---
  * Convert to/from Double to avoid precision issues.

  0.1.0.1
  -------
  * Change `tested-with` to admit the support window is only 7.8+ at this point due to the use of `Data.Coerce`

  0.1
  ---
  * Initial release

  This package supplies signed fixed-precision values 15 bits above the decimal, 16 bits below.

  These arise commonly in GPU applications and it is chosen to match the GLfixed specification.
