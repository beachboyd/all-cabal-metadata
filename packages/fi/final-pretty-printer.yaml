description: ! 'This is the Final Pretty Printer, an extensible

  prettry printing library that supports semantic

  annotations and proportional-width fonts.

  The library is extensible because it uses a

  final, rather than initial, encoding of pretty

  printer documents - they are monadic programs,

  rather than a datatype.  This means it can be

  extended by monad transformers.

  Semantic annotations allow pretty printer

  documents to contain references to the data that

  they represent, which can enable interactive output.

  Proportional-width fonts are supported by

  allowing the measurement of widths to be

  performed in some arbitrary monad, so IO can be

  used to look at the output of a font rendering library.'
