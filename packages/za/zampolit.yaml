description: ! "## Zampolit\n## Copyright (c) 2011 Brian Sniffen\n\nTo run [`Zampolit`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/zampolit)
  and\ncollect the data for these pretty graphs, you need a few things:\n\n* The version
  control system `git`, with its svn extensions.  \n* Gnuplot.\n* Haskell.\n\nAthena
  and all modern operating systems have the first two, either\ninstalled by default
  or in a locker or easily installed package.\nBut Haskell's more of a pain.  You
  can [download\nit](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), then run:\n\n    cabal
  update\n    cabal install zampolit\n    git svn clone PATH/TO/YOUR/GAME # replace
  this\n    cd YOUR/GAME\n    zampolit\n\nIt will churn for a while through the entire
  history of your game,\nthen deposit `GAME-wc.data` and `GAME-wc.gnuplot`.  If you
  have Gnuplot\ninstalled, it will even run gnuplot for you to produce `GAME-wc.pdf`.\n"
