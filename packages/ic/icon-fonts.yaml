synopsis: Package for handling icon fonts in Haskell
changelog: ! '# Revision history for icon-fonts


  ## 0.2.1.0  -- 2017-02-02


  * Add the weather icons


  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-02-02


  * Fix Graphics.Icons.AllTheIcons to have the correct types


  The types weren''t defined properly, so this is a breaking change as the types have
  changed.  Not that it really matters, since I haven''t even pushed this onto github
  yet.



  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-02-02


  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: This package is intended to provide access to a variety of icon fonts.  Everything
  is mostly a port of the all-the-icons package for emacs.  The largest difference
  is that the type system is used to ensure that the user doesn't need to worry about
  which font produces which icon.
