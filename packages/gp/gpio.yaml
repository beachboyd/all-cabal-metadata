description: ! "Haskell GPIO interface, designed specifically for the RaspberryPi.\n\nThis
  library also ships with an executable for directly running gpio commands. Note:
  when using the executable there are less guarantees about the current state of a
  pin. For example, when using the library we can be sure that an `ActivePin 'Out`
  has already been initialized and configured for writing values, when using the executable
  we are less sure, and therefore errors might occur.\n\n\nNote: this package has
  limited functionality, might be buggy and is not optimized. It works for simple
  read/write operations on a few pre-defined pins, but still needs a lot more testing.\n\nTODO:\n
  \ * Remove `runLineHack` when reading GPIO value files.\n  * Optimize file reading
  to only look at first char.\n  * Support other pin modes (in/out/up/down/pwm)\n
  \ * Support edges\n  * Look into GPIO supported file watching\n  * Add all pin numbers\n"
