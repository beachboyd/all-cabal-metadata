description: ! "                gpcsets: Pitch Class Sets for Haskell\n                           Bruce
  H. McCosar\n\n\n  *News* Version 0.9.2.0 introduces Data.PcSets.Compact, which\n
  \ allows a PcSet to be translated to and from \"Compact Format\"\n  (one alphanumeric
  character per pitch class element).\n\n\nThis is the third release for my General
  Pitch Class Sets library. It's\nstill being built. Right now I have 3 out of 5 modules
  completed. However,\nthe one module that's most complete is the main module, and
  it has been\nsubjected to an enormous amount of test code.\n\nPlaces to find out
  more information\n===================================\n\n  * http://code.google.com/p/pcsets/\n\n
  \   Pitch Class Sets for Python. The original. Only handles 12-TET. I've\n    got
  links to online Pitch Class Set references there, in case you're\n    new to all
  this.\n\n  * http://bmccosar.wordpress.com/\n\n    My Wordpress Music blog. Until
  I get the gpcsets library in final form,\n    this is the spot to find out information
  about upcoming releases and\n    current work on this project.\n\nFeatures of this
  Package\n========================\n\n  * Data.PcSets is complete. It's fully documented
  through Literate Haskell\n    AND through Haddock.\n\n  * There's an enormous test
  suite for the main module in\n    test/Test/PcSets.lhs\n\n  * Data.PcSets.Svg is
  complete, and can produce a limited range of svg\n    illustrations for pitch class
  sets.\n\n  * Data.PcSets.Compact is complete, and allows translations to and from\n
  \   \"Compact Format\" (one alphanumeric character per pitch class element,\n    eg
  [0,4,7,11] as \"047B\").\n\n  * Future modules are planned: Notes, for standard
  representations of\n    pitch class sets (eg \"C E G B\" instead of [0,4,7,11]);
  and Catalog\n    for calculating prime set catalogs in different modulus systems.\n\n
  \ * The skeletons of the other modules and test suites are there. Most of\n    the
  code is written, and just needs ported from my earlier versions\n    (which didn't
  use the Haskell class system) to the modern version.\n\nRelease Schedule\n================\n\nThis
  is still a work in progress. I released the first version as 0.9.0.x.\nEach module
  I add thereafter will increase the third number by one, eg\n0.9.1.x. Therefore,
  if I finish four new modules and four new test suites,\nI should end up at 0.9.8.x.
  When all of the smoke clears and the entire\nlibrary has been tested, tested, and
  retested, I'll call it \"stable\" and\nput it out there as 1.0.0.\n\n---\nThis file
