synopsis: GLFW OpenGL context creation for GPipe
changelog: ! '### 1.4.1.1


  * Split changelog to own file (before this, it''s located in README.md).

  * [lambdael](https://github.com/lambdael) added `glfwGetWindowSize`.

  * [Bump upper bound on `base` dependency](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/issues/2670).
  Bump stack LTS.


  ### 1.4.1


  * Split `Wrapped` module to `Window` and `Misc` modules.

  * Don''t expose `ErrorCallback`, do expose  the `Error` type for custom error callbacks.

  * Switch from ad-hoc parenting for shared contexts, to the "ancestor" pattern described
  in [#24](https://github.com/plredmond/GPipe-GLFW/issues/24#issuecomment-299681824).

  * Adjustments to debug logging format.

  * Add smoketest for window close functions & sequential GPipe windows.

  * Bump deps to `GPipe-2.2.1`


  ### 1.4.0


  * Rewrite for new window handling interface.

  * Separate smoke tests to own package.


  ### 1.3.0


  * Overhaul `Graphics.GPipe.Context.GLFW.Input` to expose most of the functionality
  in [GLFW Input guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html).


  ### 1.2.3


  * [SwiftsNamesake](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake) bumped version constraints.

  * Add a smoke test and stubs for shared-context tests.


  ### 1.2.2


  * [grtlr](https://github.com/grtlr) added scroll callback registration.

  * Add a readme to be a good citizen and update documentation.


  ### 1.2.1


  * [bch29](https://github.com/bch29) refactored and added new GLFW input callback
  registration functions as well as the `unsafe` module to access the GLFW window
  directly.


  ### 1.2


  * [bch29](https://github.com/bch29) exposed more of the underlying GLFW hints.
