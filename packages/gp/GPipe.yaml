changelog: ! "### 2.2.3\r\n\r\n- Removing an unnecessary optimization that was broken
  since 2.2\r\n\r\n### 2.2.2\r\n\r\n- Support for GHC 8.2.1 (#52)\r\n- Fixing errors
  with hidden contexts\r\n- Fixing GLSL link error on subtracting a negative constant
  (#55)\r\n- Fixing GLSL ambiguous overload with \"clamp\" (#51)\r\n- Adding atan2'
  (#44)\r\n\r\n### 2.2.1\r\n\r\n- Render monad would crash if using deleted windows,
  when that should be a no-op. (#41).\r\n- Manually deleting last visible window causes
  objects to be deleted (#42).\r\n\r\n### 2.2\r\n\r\n- Windows are now explicit objects
  dynamically created and deleted with newWindow and deleteWindow, and are sent as
  parameter to drawWindowColor et al. (#18)\r\n- Each window created can now take
  their own window manager specific parameters (#19)\r\n- Update to GHC 8.0.2 and
  gl-0.8.0 (#38)\r\n\r\n### 2.1.8\r\n\r\n- Update dependencies to make it build with
  stack resolver nightly-2016-09-24\r\n\r\n### 2.1.7\r\n\r\n- Runtime optimizations
  (Use BaseVertex for glDraw* instead of offsetting each attribute)\r\n\r\n### 2.1.6\r\n\r\n-
  Adding support for normal Floats, Int32s and Word32s in PrimitiveStreams\r\n- Runtime
  optimizations\r\n\r\n### 2.1.5\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug in clear where masks weren't set\r\n-
  Added up to 7-tuple instances\r\n\r\n### 2.1.4\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug in dropVertices
  and dropIndices (#16)\r\n- Added withPointSize (#15)\r\n\r\n### 2.1.3\r\n\r\n- Fixed
  bug in clearImage\r\n\r\n### 2.1.2\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug when nesting while, ifThen,
  ifThenElse or ifThenElse'.\r\n\r\n### 2.1.1\r\n\r\n- Made ifB use ifThenElse' instead
  to avoid unwanted strictness\r\n- Fixed bug where ShaderBaseType for () wasn't lazy
  enough, causing error in ifThenElse'\r\n- Added missing () instances\r\n\r\n###
  2.1\r\n\r\n- Making dangling finalizers work with shared and unshared contexts (#10)\r\n-
  Moved orphan instances to separate module (#11)\r\n- Fixing a bug introduced in
  2.0.2 when using multiple uniforms\r\n- Fixing exception when using conditionals
  in the shader (#12)\r\n\r\n### 2.0.2\r\n\r\n- Linear bumped to 1.20\r\n- Running
  contextSwap and contextFrameBufferSize on right thread (#7)\r\n- render now throws
  if rendering to an image from a texture thats used for sampling (#8)\r\n- Added
  GPipe class instances for all linear types (#9)\r\n\r\n### 2.0.1\r\n\r\n- Fixed
  runtime error in simple fragment program when not all uniforms where used (#5)\r\n\r\n###
  2.0\r\n\r\n- Initial release of GPipe 2\r\n"

description: ! 'A typesafe API based on the conceptual model of OpenGl, but without
  the imperative state machine.

  Aims to be as close to the raw OpenGl performance as possible, without compromising
  type safety or functional style.

  Includes DSL for shaders to provide type safety even when crossing into that domain.

  Uses OpenGl 3.3 core profile under the hood.'
