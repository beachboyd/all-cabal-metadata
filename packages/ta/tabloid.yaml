description: ! "\nTabloid is a gtk program that captures output from arbitrary shell
  commands in tables. \nEach line can be separated with regular expressions. It aims
  to be somewhere between a \ngraphical awk and excel, although less powerful than
  both in every respect, it will \nhelp analyze large logfiles. It allows outputs
  of diffrent programs/shellscripts \nto be viewed directly.\n"
