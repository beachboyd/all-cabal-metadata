  # tasty-mgolden

  Text based [golden tests](https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-12-04-golden-tests)
  for [tasty](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty), with multi line (colored) diff expectation
  failure reporting.

  Basically this package can turn any `IO Text` action into a golden test via providing a
  `FilePath`.

  This package is the small brother of [tasty-golden](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty-golden)
  which also implements the same golden testing pattern.

  `tasty-mgolden` is less generic and more opinionated than its bigger brother.
  But for that reason can also offer more ergonomic defaults for its core use case:

  Golden testing for `IO Text` actions. Where:

  * The text value is assuemd to contain multiple lines.
  * The expectation failures can be rendered nicely in multi line diffs.
  * The diff lines are colored via the tasty infrastructure
  * The diff rendering is not done via the external `diff` command, but uses the `Diff` package.

  Expectation diffs are rendered like developers are used to:

  * Removed lines rendered in red.
  * Added lines in green.

  ## Usage

  This is taken from the [example](example) directory in the repository.

  To run these execute from repository root:

  ```
  stack build
  stack exec tasty-mgolden-example
  ```

  Contents of [example/example-a.txt](example/example-a.txt)

  ```
  foo
  bar
  ```

  Contents of [example/example-b.txt](example/example-b.txt)

  ```
  foo
  bar
  ```

  Contents: `example/Test.hs`

  ```haskell
  import Test.Tasty
  import Test.Tasty.MGolden

  main :: IO ()
  main = defaultMain $ testGroup "golden tests"
    [ goldenTest "example-a" "example/example-a.txt" $ pure "foo\nbar\n"
    , goldenTest "example-b" "example/example-b.txt" $ pure "foo\nbaz\n"
    ]
  ```

  Output:

  ```diff
  golden tests
    example-a: OK
    example-b: FAIL
   foo
  -bar
  +baz

  1 out of 2 tests failed (0.00s)
  ```

  Passing the `--update` flag to accept the changes:

  ```
  golden tests
    example-a: OK
    example-b: OK
      UPDATE

  All 2 tests passed (0.00s)
  ```

  ### TODOs

  PRs on these are welcome.

  * Improve the multi line diff reporting to only show a
    minimal context around the changed hunks.
  * Add line markers in unified diff format.
  * Change to `pathtype` from `filepath`
  * Future? Upstream this to `tasty-golden` ?
