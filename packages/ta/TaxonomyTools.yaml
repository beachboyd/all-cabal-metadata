description: ! 'Taxonomy Tool utilizes functions from the Taxonomy library to provide


  several commandline utilities for routine-tasks with taxonomy data.


  Currently some tools accept either the <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/ NCBI
  taxonomy dump> as input,


  while other retrieve the data directly from the <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/
  NCBI Entrez REST> interface.


  It is planned to support both datasources with each tool.


  Usage instructions can be found in the <https://github.com/eggzilla/TaxonomyTools
  README>


  Currently following Tools are included:


  * Accessions2TaxIds:

  Converts a list of NCBI accession numbers into NCBI taxonomy ids


  * TaxIds2Tree:

  List of taxonomy ids is converted into a graphical tree representation

  either as .svg (via graphviz) or as .json (via d3js).


  * TaxIds2TreeCompare:

  Multiple lists of taxonomy ids are converted into a visualisation of the

  taxonomic tree highlighting the input nodes corresponding to their list.


  * TaxIds2Text:

  List of taxonomy ids is converted in a short text summary for each node.


  * TreeDistance:

  Computes the distance between two input nodes on the given tree.'
