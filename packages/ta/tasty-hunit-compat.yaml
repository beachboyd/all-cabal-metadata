  # Tasty-hunit-compat

  ![Build status](https://github.com/serokell/tasty-hunit-compat/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

  This library implements the integration between [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty) and [HUnit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit) packages.

  The way tasty provides this integration is reimplementing HUnit primitives, and this does not work with test suites written with the original HUnit library.
  One issue we are aware of is that test failures are treated as plain exceptions, not true failures.

  ## Build Instructions [↑](#-patak)

  Run `make` to build everything.

  ## Usage [↑](#-patak)

  Use `testCase` or more advanced primitives to lift HUnit's `Assertion` to tasty's `TestTree`.

  Commonly useful methods from `HUnit` are also re-exported.

  ```haskell
  import Test.Tasty (TestTree)
  import Test.Tasty.HUnit (testCase, (@?=))

  test_Reversals :: [TestTree]
  test_Reversals =
    [ testCase "Simple case" $
        reverse "abc" @?= "cba"
    ]
  ```
