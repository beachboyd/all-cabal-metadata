synopsis: HUnit support for the Tasty test framework.
changelog: ! 'Changes

  =======


  Version 0.10

  ------------


  * Make `assertFailure`''s return type polymorphic

  * When a test fails, print the source location of the failing assertion

  * Deprecate `Assertable`, `AssertionPredicate`, `AssertionPredicable`, `(@?)`


  Version 0.9.2

  -------------


  Add `testCaseInfo` for tests that return some information upon success


  Version 0.9.1

  -------------


  Add `testCaseSteps` for multi-step tests


  Version 0.9.0.1

  ---------------


  Split the changelog out of the main tasty changelog


  Version 0.9

  -----------


  tasty-hunit now does not depend on the original HUnit package. The functions

  that were previously re-exported from HUnit have been simply copied to

  tasty-hunit.


  This is motivated by:


  * efficiency (one less package to compile/install)

  * reliability (if something happens with HUnit, we won''t be affected)


  The two packages are still compatible, except for the name clashes and

  distinct exception types being thrown on assertion failures.


  Version 0.8.0.1

  ---------------


  Fix unbuildable haddock


  Version 0.8

  -----------


  * Exceptions are now handled by tasty rather than by HUnit

  * Update to tasty-0.8


  Version 0.4.1

  -------------


  Do not re-export HUnit''s `Testable` class


  Version 0.2

  -----------


  Re-export useful bits of `Test.HUnit` from `Test.Tasty.HUnit`
