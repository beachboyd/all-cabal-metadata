  Version 0.9.0.1
  ---------------

  Split the changelog out of the main tasty changelog

  Version 0.9
  -----------

  tasty-hunit now does not depend on the original HUnit package. The functions
  that were previously re-exported from HUnit have been simply copied to
  tasty-hunit.

  This is motivated by:

  * efficiency (one less package to compile/install)
  * reliability (if something happens with HUnit, we won't be affected)

  The two packages are still compatible, except for the name clashes and
  distinct exception types being thrown on assertion failures.

  Version 0.8.0.1
  ---------------

  Fix unbuildable haddock

  Version 0.8
  -----------

  * Exceptions are now handled by tasty rather than by HUnit
  * Update to tasty-0.8

  Version 0.4.1
  -------------

  Do not re-export HUnit's `Testable` class

  Version 0.2
  -----------

  Re-export useful bits of `Test.HUnit` from `Test.Tasty.HUnit`

  HUnit support for the Tasty test framework.

  Note that this package does not depend on HUnit but
  implements the relevant subset of its API. The name is a
  legacy of the early versions of tasty-hunit and of
  test-framework-hunit, which did depend on HUnit.
