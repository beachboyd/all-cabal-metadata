  Behavior-driven development \n\n## A [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) Behavior
  Driven Development framework featuring:\n\n* A type constrained language to express\n
  \ *  *Given* as ordered preconditions or\n  *  *GivenAndAfter* as oredered preconditions
  with reversed order of teardown actions (sort of resource management)\n  *  One
  only *When* to introduce a last precondition and catch it's output to be fed to\n
  \ *  Some *Then* tests that will receive the output of *When*\n* Support for do
  notation via free monad for composing _givens_ and _thens_ \n* One monad independent
  pure interpreter\n* One driver for the great [tasty](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty)
  test library,  monad parametrized\n* Support for [tasty-fail-fast](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-fail-fast)
  strategy flag which will not execute the teardown actions of the failed test\n*
  A sophisticated form of value introspection to show the differences on equality
  failure from [tree-diff](https://github.com/phadej/tree-diffdifftree) package \n*
  Recursive test decorators to prepend or append action to all the tests inside a
  test tree\n\n## Background\n\n[Behavior Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
  is a software development process that emerged from test-driven development (TDD)
  and is based on principles of [Hoare Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic).
  The process requires a strict structure of the tests - {Given} When {Then} - to
  make them understandable.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nimport Test.Tasty.Bdd\n\ntests ::
  TestTree\ntests = testBdd \"Test sequence\" \n    $ Given (print \"Some effect\")\n
  \   $ Given (print \"Another effect\")\n    $ GivenAndAfter (print \"Aquiring resource\"
  >> return \"Resource 1\")\n                    (print . (\"Release \"++))\n    $
  GivenAndAfter (print \"Aquiring resource\" >> return \"Resource 2\")\n                    (print
  . (\"Release \"++))\n    $ When (print \"Action returning\" >> return ([1..10]++[100..106])
  :: IO [Int])\n    $ Then (@?= ([1..10]++[700..706]))\n    $ End\n```\n"
