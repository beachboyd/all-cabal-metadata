description: |-
  Many specifications provide test vectors for their algorithms, particularly
  specifications for cryptographic primatives. These are like QuickCheck properties
  in that they provide some function input and check the output, but unlike QuickCheck
  the inputs and expected results are predefined.

  This library provides an interface for cleanly integrating such test vectors into
  the 'tasty' test framework.
