description: ! "Tables\n------\nTables is a command-line program for accessing Quill
  databases. It supports an English-like argument structure, typed Elements, truly
  whitespace independant parsing, and some advanced composite functions.\n\n## Argument
  rundown\nTables [filename] get x from y\n\nTables [filename] get x\n\nTables [filename]
  add x as y\n\nTables [filename] add x to y as z\n\nTables [filename] remove x from
  y\n\nTables [filename] remove x\n\nTables [filename] change x in y to z\n\nTables
  [filename] map x to y as z\n\nTables [filename] combine x with y as z\n\nTables
  [filename] file x\n\nTables [filename] list\n\nTables [filename] x and y and...\n\nTables
  [filename] repl\n\n## Table syntax\nThe actual flat file has a somewhat human readable
  syntax. Here is a file showing all possible use cases:\n\n    table(tableName){`preserve
  whitespace`:val;key1:val1;}\n\tlist(listName){a;b;c} /* I'm a comment! */\n\n###
  Sales pitch\nTables is relatively safe (it won't delete its own file anymore, and
  probably won't burn your house down). It is built upon a rock-solid library (Cookbook)
  and a slightly-less rock-solid concept. The Haskell type system makes the base Quill
  library safe in regards to unexpected behavior, although there are some errors that
  Tables cannot recover from.\n"
