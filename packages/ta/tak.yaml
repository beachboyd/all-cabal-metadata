description: ! 'Tak is a new abstract strategy game, devised by James Earnest (of
  Cheapass

  Games), and Patrick Rothfuss, author of The Wise Man''s Fear, where the game of

  Tak was first mentioned.

  This is a library which encodes the rules of Tak, provides a client for the

  popular playtak.com server, and contributes an AI tak bot for the same server.

  This package provides 3 top level modules:

  Tak encodes the rules of Tak, as a game tree, containing all possible moves.

  This tree is extremely large, so be careful not to strictly evaluate it!

  PlayTak provides functions for maintaining a connection to playtak.com, receiving

  messages, and sending commands. This could be used to implement a

  fully-fledged game client, or a playtak.com bot.

  PlayTakBot is a framework to make it easy to build a playtak.com bot. It will

  maintain a connection, seek games, and create a game tree. The bot implementor

  just needs to provide functions to evaluate a game state, and choose the next

  play from each game state.'
