description: ! "Tableaux theorem prover for first order logic\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis
  is a simple interactive theorem prover for first order logic\nusing the tableaux
  method. The \"tableau\" is a tree depicting a proof\nwhere each node is a sentence;
  linear branches represent conjunctions\nwhile forks represent disjunctions. At each
  step one introduces\nnew nodes by \"breaking down\" a formula into its logical\nconsequences.
  To prove a formula F it is sufficient to show that\n~F is unsatisfiable, i.e. that
  all branches of the tableau lead\nto contradictions.\n  \nThe prover is implemented
  in Haskell as a CGI that shows the\ncurrent proof tree and highlights one focus
  node\n(initially the whole formula). The interface is consists of:\n* navigate the
  proof tree (point and click)\n* expand the current node \n* apply resolution to
  the branch with the current node\n\nClosed branches end in a \"false\" sentence,
  i.e. have been shown to \nbe inconsistent/unsatisfiable. To prove the original theorem
  one must close\nall branches.\n\n\nPedro Vasconcelos <pbv@dcc.fc.up.pt>, 2009.\nTree
