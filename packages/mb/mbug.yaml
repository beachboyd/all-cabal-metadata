  ## Rationale


  This program makes working with old Debian bugs much more pleasant.

  Sometimes I want to have personal bug-squashing party, so you open

  [https://bugs.debian.org/kaction@gnu.org] in web-browser, and get nice

  list of bugs that require my attention.


  Browsing is great, but when I want to do something with those bugs --

  close, add tags, discuss, I have to copy bug number, launch mail client

  in another terminal and compose email to [mailto:nnn@bugs.debian.org].


  Should I need to quote some previous message, more distracting actions

  are to be done -- download whole bug as mbox, incorporate that mbox into

  my mail system (I prefer MH), and only after that real work could start.


  DebBugs has also email interface -- you can request sending to you bugs

  you want, but reply is also optimized for reading, not for manipulating.

  Honestly, it looks like corresponding web page, filtered by `lynx`.


  ## Solution


  ~~~~

  mbug [--into <folder>] <query>

  ~~~~


  It will download mbox of every bug, listed at

  `https://bugs.debian.org/<query>` and create `+<folder>` MH folder. In

  that folder subfolder for every bug is created. By default, `<folder>`

  is `debbugs`.


  Folder `+<folder>` is volatile, every new invocation of `mbox` will

  overwrite its previous content. This way you can focus on bugs you are

  interested in right now.
