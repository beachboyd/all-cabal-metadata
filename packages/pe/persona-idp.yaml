description: ! "persona-idp is a simple `Mozilla Persona`_ (formerly BrowserID)\nidentity
  provider (IdP).\n\n.. _Mozilla Persona: https://www.mozilla.org/persona\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstallation
  is via ``cabal``, the Haskell package tool::\n\n    cabal install persona-idp\n\nHelp
  packaging persona-idp for specific operating systems would be\nvery much appreciated.\n\n\nInitialisation\n==============\n\nTo
  initialise the IdP, run::\n\n    persona init --app-path <path> --hostname <host>\n\nThe
  ``--app-path`` argument species the path under the domain at\nwhich the IdP will
  be mounted.  If it is at the root, use `/`.\n\nThe ``--hostname`` argument is the
  fully qualified domain name of\nthe *authority*, which will either be the users'
  email domain, or\nthe host that is delegated to when using a *delegated support\ndocument*.\n\nThe
  ``init`` command generates the authority keypair and support\ndocuments.  Files
  are stored in ``~/.persona-idp``.  There is\ncurrently no mechanism for overriding
  the config directory - patches\nwelcome!\n\n\nStarting the server\n===================\n\nTo
  run the IdP, execute::\n\n    persona serve\n\nThe IdP listens on port 3000 by default
  (use ``-p <port>`` to listen\non a different port) and is designed to be run behind
  a reverse\nproxy providing TLS termination and user authentication.\n\n\nWeb server
  configuration\n========================\n\nTLS is required.  Acquiring a server
  certificate and enabling TLS is\nbeyond the scope of this README.\n\npersona-idp
  requires the webserver to authenticate users.  Several\nmechanisms are supported:\n\n*
  Any authentication mechanism where the user's email address can be\n  provided to
  the IdP via the ``REMOTE_USER`` HTTP header.  For\n  security reasons, this header
  MUST NOT be passed from the original\n  request to the IdP.\n\n* X.509 client certificate
  authentication can be used.  The\n  ``REMOTE_USER`` header MUST NOT be set, and
  the PEM-encoded client\n  certificate is provided in the ``SSL_CLIENT_CERT`` header.
  \ The\n  email address is first looked for in the Subject Alternative Name\n  extension,
  then the Subject DN.\n\nSupport for other authentication methods could be added.
  \ Please\ncontact the author to discuss.\n\nNginx\n-----\n\nThe following example
  explains how to configure Nginx to use client\ncertificate authentication.  The
  IdP is assumed to be running on the\nsame host as Nginx and listening on port 3000.\n\nNginx
  does not support the ``ssl_verify_client`` directive in\nlocation context, so the
  server as a whole must request (but not\nrequire) a client certificate.  If a valid
  certificate is provided,\ndetails are passed to the IdP via the ``proxy_set_header``\ndirective.\n\n::\n\n
  \   server {\n        listen 443 ssl;\n        server_name persona.example.com;\n
  \       ssl_certificate /path/to/chainedcert.pem;\n        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key;\n\n
  \       ssl_client_certificate /path/to/ca.pem;\n        ssl_verify_client optional;\n
  \       proxy_set_header REMOTE_USER \"\";\n        proxy_set_header SSL_CLIENT_CERT
  $ssl_client_cert;\n\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n
  \       }\n    }\n\nIf the IdP is not mounted at the root, two location blocks are\nrequired.
  \ The mount point is the ``--app-path`` argument\nused for ``persona init``::\n\n
  \   server {\n        ...  # as above\n\n        location /the/mountpoint {\n            proxy_pass
  http://localhost:3000;\n        }\n\n        location /.well-known/browserid {\n
  \           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/support;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nFinally,
  any hosts delegating to the authority can also be\nconfigured to read the delegated
  support document from the IdP::\n\n    server {\n        listen 443 ssl;\n        servername
  example.com;\n\n        ...\n\n        location /.well-known/browserid {\n            proxy_pass
  http://localhost:3000/delegated-support;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nApache\n------\n\nThe
  Apache configuration is similar to the Nginx configuration, but\nnote that Apache
  supports ``SSLVerifyClient`` in location context so\nso the server could be configured
  to *require* a valid client\ncertificate for the ``/provisioning`` location whilst
  not requesting\na certificate for other locations.  Such a configuration requires\nTLS
  renegotiation and is untested - but if you try it I would like\nto know your results.\n\nA
  complete example configuration for Apache would be a valued\ncontribution to this
  README.\n\n\nTesting the IdP\n===============\n\n#. Ensure that the browser will
  be able to authenticate the user\n   when the provisioning workflow begins (e.g.
  install client\n   certificate if using certificate authentication).\n\n#. Visit
  https://login.persona.org/ and click *Sign In*.\n\n#. Enter your email address and
  click *next*.\n\n#. If prompted, select a certificate or complete the required\n
  \  authentication.  The login process should now complete without\n   further interaction.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\npersona-idp
