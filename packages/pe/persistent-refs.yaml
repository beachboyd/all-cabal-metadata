description: ! 'This library provides support for a persistent version of the

  ''Control.Monad.ST.ST'' monad. Internally, references are backed by a

  ''Data.IntMap.IntMap'', rather than being mutable variables on the

  heap. This decreases performance, but can be useful in certain

  settings, particularly those involving backtracking.'
