description: ! 'This library includes data types for storing permutations and

  combinations.  It implements pure and impure types, the latter of

  which can be modified in-place.  The library uses aggressive

  inlining and MutableByteArray#s internally, so it is very

  efficient.


  The main utility of the library is converting between the linear

  representation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.  This

  allows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse

  to an array with O(1) memory use.


  Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation

  and combination functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
