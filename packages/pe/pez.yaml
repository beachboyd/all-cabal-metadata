description: ! 'PEZ is a generic zipper library. It uses lenses from the "fclabels"
  package to

  reference a \"location\" to move to in the zipper. The zipper is restricted to

  types in the ''Typeable'' class, allowing the user to \"move up\" through complex
  data

  structures such as mutually-recursive types.


  Both the Typeable class and fclabels lenses can be derived in GHC, making it

  easy for the programmer to use a zipper with a minimum of boilerplate.


  Please send any feature requests or bug reports along.


  Changes 0.0.4 -> 0.1.0:


  >  - use fclabels 1.0

  >  - module renamed Data.Label.Zipper

  >  - ''ZPath'' renamed ''Motion'', define new Up type and instance

  >  - fclabels lenses now require wrapping with ''to''

  >  - ''moveTo'' changed to ''move''

  >  - savedLens renamed flatten

  >  - SavedPath renamed To

  >  - removed experimental operators

  >  - using failure package for exceptions

  >  - etc., etc.
