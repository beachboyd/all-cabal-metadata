synopsis: Quickly detect clusters and holes in data.
changelog: ! "# Revision history for Persistence\n\n## 1.0  -- 2018-05-11\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 1.1  -- 2018-05-27\n\n### Added\n-
  Bottleneck distance, a way to compare the topology of different data sets.\n- HasseDiagram
  module, will allow users to deduce topological features of information flow in networks.\n-
  A function for encoding generic graphs as 2D vectors.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved
  documentation for all exposed modules.     \n\n## 1.1.3 -- 2018-07-30\n\n### Changed\n\n-
  Fixed a major bug with persistent homology; high dimensional holes were being detected
  in low dimensional data sets.\n- Persistent homology now filters out bar codes of
  the form (i, Just i), as they say nothing about the topology of the underlying complexes.\n\n##
  1.1.4 -- 2018-09-15\n\n### Changed\n\n- Fixed spelling error.\n- Persistence now
  exports the constructors for `Extended a`.\n\n## 1.1.4.1 -- 2018-09-15\n\n### Changed\n\n-
  Fixed all spelling errors, should actually build now.\n\n## 1.1.4.2 -- 2018-09-15\n\n###
  Changed\n\n- Fixed non-exhaustive pattern match in `BottleNeckDistance` functions."

description: Persistence is a topological data analysis library motivated by flexibility
  when it comes to the type of data being analyzed. If you have data that comes with
  a meaningful function into something of the Ord typeclass, you can use Persistence
  to detect clusters and holes in the data. You can also use the library to analyze
  the topology of directed\/undirected weighted\/unweighted graphs, and compare topologies
  of different data sets.
