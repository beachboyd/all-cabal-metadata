description: ! 'This is the package with executables and documentation for Penny.
  To

  compile and install the binaries, running "cabal install" will work.


  To install the manual pages and the documentation, run "sh

  install-docs". It will install the manual pages to $PREFIX/share/man

  and the other documentation to $PREFIX/share/doc/penny. By default

  $PREFIX is /usr/local; you can change this by editing the

  install-docs file and changing the "PREFIX" variable.


  To remove the manual pages and the documentation, run "sh

  install-docs remove."


  The first thing you will want to look at is the manual page

  penny-basics(7).  Then you will want to examine the starter.pny file

  in the examples directory, which will show you how to write a ledger

  file. penny-suite(7) will then direct you to other documentation that

  may interest you.
