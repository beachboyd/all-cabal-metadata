description: ! 'This is a personal set of helper functions used to create a web API
  service.


  We assume that the service is intended to run in a container on a Kubernetes

  cluster, but it\''s likely that these routines would be useful for other

  services.


  We provide command-line options for use with optparse-applicative,

  Prometheus instrumentation, and some basic logging.'
