description: ! "Welcome to Keera Posture\n\nThis application tries to detect your
  posture while you sit and warns you when\nit deviates too much from a reference
  posture given during configuration. It\nmay be used, among other things, to help
  you detect when you are sitting in a\nstraining position.\n\nWARNING: No promises
  are made about this program. If you use it, you'll do so\nunder your own risk. This
  program might make your computer explode, kill your\ncat, or make your back pain
  problems worse. Use it with care and under medical\nsupervision only. Report any
  issues with the program to Keera Studios by email,\nfacebook, linkedin or google
  plus. It is best used in combination with programs\nthat force you to take regular
  breaks, stretch, etc. By continuing to use\nkeera-posture, you are agreeing not
  to sue us or Keera Studios Ltd.\n\nINSTALLATION (default)\n=====================================\n\nKeera
  Posture is available on hackage. Unless you need the latest development\nversion,
  the recommended way is to install the version there.\n\nI often use cabal sandboxes
  (```cabal sandbox init```). I recommend the following:\n\n1) Install C/C++ development
  headers. That includes gtk, sdl, opengl, opencv.\n\n2) Update your hackage DB using
  ```cabal update```.\n\n3) Install gtk2hs-buildtools (```cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools```).\nAdjust
  your PATH to find the path where the binaries have been placed.\n\n4) Install keera-posture
  (```cabal install keera-posture```).\n\nINSTALLATION ON DEBIAN (the not-so-easy
  way; but still quite easy)\n==================================================================\n\nYou
  need to have git, cabal, cabal-dev and ghc installed. Everything else will\nbe installed
  for you. You also need to run sudo (at least once) so that the script\ncan sudo
  without a password whenever it needs to.\n\nIf you do not know how to install cabal-dev,
  run:\n\n    $ cabal install cabal-dev\n    $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cabal/bin\n\nAfter
  that, all you need is:\n\n    $ mkdir -p keera-posture && cd keera-posture && (wget
  -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keera-studios/keera-posture/master/debian/package-from-scratch.sh
  | bash)\n\nThis will create all the necessary directories, check out all sources,
  prompt\nto install dependencies, compile the whole program, and create a DEB file
  for your\narchitecture and version of debian/ubuntu. If it works, install that.\n\nCOMPILATION
  ON OTHER LINUX/UNIX SYSTEMS (not so easy, not so hard)\n==================================================================\n\nAgain,
  you need to have ghc, cabal, cabal-dev and git. You also need some\nlibraries installed
  (GL, SDL, SDL-mixer, FTGL, OpenCV, Gtk2, Glade2). The list\nfor debian systems is:\n\n-
  libopencv-dev libglade2-dev libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libftgl-dev libsdl1.2-dev
  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev \n\nI don't use Fedora, so you have to find which ones are yours.
  Then, run the following:\n\n    $ mkdir -p keera-posture && cd keera-posture &&
  (wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keera-studios/keera-posture/master/installation.sh
  | bash)\n\nThis will check out, compile and install everything you need.\n\nDOING
  EVERYTHING BY HAND (only for developers)\n==============================================\n\nDependencies
  (tools):\n- alex (gtk2hs-buildtools), happy (gtk2hs-buildtools), gtk2hs-buildtools.\n\nDependencies
  (libraries):\n- libopencv-dev libglade2-dev libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libftgl-dev\n
  \ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev \n\n (If you use debian/ubuntu, you can install
  all of those with apt-get)\n\nInstallation instructions (for ubuntu, but the program
  is known to work on Windows):\n\n1) Assuming you have ghc and cabal, create a sandbox
  and fix your PATH.\n\n    $ cabal sandbox init\n    $ export PATH=$PWD/.cabal-sandbox/bin:$PATH\n\n2)
  Install all the libraries that this depends on:\n\n    $ apt-get install libopencv-dev
  libglade2-dev libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libftgl-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev\n\n3)
  Update your package list, install dependencies.\n\n    $ cabal install alex\n    $
  cabal install happy\n    $ cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools\n\n4) Install keera-posture\n\n
  \   $ cabal install keera-posture\n\n5) Keera posture will be installed in keera-posture/cabal-dev/bin/keera-posture.\nIf
  you want to create a desktop launcher, https://raw.github.com/keera-studios/keera-posture/master/data/icon-good-posture.png
  can make a good icon.\n\n6) Go to your preferred social network and like Keera Studios,
  share our posts,\nfollow us, tell all your friends about it. Record a video of you
  using the\nprogram, and upload it to youtube.\n\nCalibration\n===========\nThe first
  time you run the program, you have to calibrate it. Just sit how you\nthink you
  should sit (and consult a physician if you don't know how to sit\nproperly) and
  right-click on its icon, and click on \"Calibrate\". Follow the\nassistant, and
  the program will detect you and record your position.\n\nAfter that, the position
  will be saved in a config file and the program will\nwarn you (using sound, a window
  and/or changing the tray icon) when your\nposture is too different from what it
  was when you calibrated the program.\n\nTest the program. The placement of your
  webcam and the amount of light\nin the room can influence the accuracy of this system,
  so feel free to\nexperiment and find out how to get better results. Also, if you
  can think of\nnew features that might be useful, go online and open a ticket on
  the program's\ngithub page.\n\nReferences\n==========\nKeera Hails - Reactive Values:
