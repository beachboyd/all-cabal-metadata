  Keera Hails is a rapid application development system.

  The idea behind Hails is that you should be able to build cross platform
  applications with minimal effort, very quickly, and the result should be easy
  to maintain.

  This package includes functions to create multi-language applications using
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext gettext>. It includes two modules: one
  to translate strings in your program, and one to load the settings from your
  configuration in your application to let users select the language.

  As an application developer, the expectation is that you would offer a way
  for users to change the language in their preferences, and that that language
  selection would be stored in a configuration file named "default-language".
