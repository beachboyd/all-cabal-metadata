description: ! "# Howdy, this is Ketchup!\r\n\r\nKetchup is a very small HTTP server
  implementation, currently [300 LoC total](http://ix.io/gkV)!\r\n\r\nKetchup is also
  made to be as modular and embeddable as possible, if you want a cabal-free Haskell
  app, just take those two/three files you need and put it in your project!\r\n\r\nCurrently
  Ketchup comes with:\r\n\r\n- Basic httpd functionality (IPV4 only for now)\r\n-
  URL Routing with parameters (ie. `/user/:name/`)\r\n- Static file handler (ie. `static
  \".\"` as route/handler)\r\n- Basic Auth (please use it over a HTTPS reverse proxy)\r\n\r\n###
  Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe core parts of Ketchup are all depedency free, that includes
  Ketchup.Httpd and Ketchup.Utils (and to a certain extent, Ketchup.Chunked).\r\nThe
  dependencies required are for the following modules:\r\n\r\n- Ketchup.Static (uses
  **mime-types**)\r\n- Ketchup.Auth (uses **base64-bytestring**)\r\n\r\n### A word
  of warning\r\n\r\nKetchup is not a competitor to Snap / Happstack / Yesod / etc.,
  Being designed to be small, Ketchup doesn't have or care about high performance
  / templating etc., Ketchup doesn't even have HTTPS!\r\n"
