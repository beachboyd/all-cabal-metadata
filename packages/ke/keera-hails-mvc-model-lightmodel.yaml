description: |-
  Light Protected Models are Thread-safe (STM) Reactive Models with change
  propagation and notification. They are meant to enclose a whole (MVC)
  application's model, using field accessors to access every part of a Protected
  Model as a Reactive Value. Unline full Protected Models, Light models do not
  have an undo/redo queue.
