  # jsonpath-hs

  Implementation of jsonpath as [described by Steffen GÃ¶essner](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).

  ## State of this library

  This library is still work in progress, but feel free to use it create issues. It lacks some features and has a few variances from the description.

  ### Missing Features
  * The Length funtion: The ability to say `$.length`. It will just look for `length` key as of now.
  * ScriptExpression: The ability to say things like `$.book[(3+1)]`

  ### Variances
  * The `$` sign in the beginning is not compulsory
  * The `$..*` will not produce the root object itself.
  ## Shout out to [JSON-Path-Test-Suite](https://github.com/gregsdennis/JSON-Path-Test-Suite/tree/master/Tests)
  I have copied a few of the tests from there, I will probably just sub-module the repository if and when the whole test suite is green.

  ## Uses
  I am using this library to support GCP authentication in the [Kubernetes haskell client](http://github.com/kubernetes-client/haskell).
