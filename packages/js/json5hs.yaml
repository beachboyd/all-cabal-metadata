description: |-
  The JSON5 Data Interchange Format (JSON5) is a superset of JSON
  that aims to alleviate some of the limitations of JSON by expanding
  its syntax to include some productions from ECMAScript 5.1.

  This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting
  between Haskell values and JSON5.
