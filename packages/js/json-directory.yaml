description: |
  Provides utilities for reading JSON structures out of directories. Directory
  entries become keys in a map, and the values are sourced from the contets of
  each entry.

   * Directories are recured into
   * Files ending with `.json` are read as JSON values
   * Everything else is interpreted as a string

  The [example](./example) directory in this repository would result in
  the following JSON value.

  ```json
  {
    "empty": {},
    "a": "This is files will have its contents written into a JSON string.\n",
    "d": {
      "example": "Sometimes it's convenient to embed some raw JSON"
    },
    "b": 42,
    "c": {
      "nested": "You can nest directories to create a tree structure.\n"
    }
  }
  ```
