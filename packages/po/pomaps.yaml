description: ! "# [pomaps][] [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sgraf812/pomaps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sgraf812/pomaps)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/pomaps.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pomaps)\r\n\r\nReasonably
  fast maps (and possibly sets) based on keys satisfying [`PartialOrd`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lattices-1.6.0/docs/Algebra-PartialOrd.html#t:PartialOrd).\r\n\r\nThis
  package tries to load off as much work as possible to the excellent [`containers`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers)
  library, in order to achieve acceptable performance.\r\nThe interface is kept as
  similar to [`Data.Map.{Strict/Lazy}`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.10.2/docs/Data-Map-Strict.html)
  as possible, which is an excuse for somewhat lacking documentation.\r\n\r\n`POMap`s
  basically store a decomposition of totally ordered chains (e.g. something `Map`s
  can handle).\r\nFunctionality and strictness properties should be pretty much covered
  by the testsuite.\r\nBut it's not battle-tested yet, so if you encounter space leaks
  in the implementation, let me know.\r\n\r\nA rather naive implementation leads to
  `O(w*n*log n)` lookups, where `w` is the width of the decomposition (which should
  be the size of the biggest anti-chain).\r\nThis is enough for me at the moment to
  get things going, but there is room for improvement ([Sorting and Selection in Posets](https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1532)).\r\nLet
  me know if things are too slow and I'll see what I can do!\r\n\r\n[pomaps]: https://github.com/sgraf812/pomaps\r\n"
