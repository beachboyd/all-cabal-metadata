description: ! "pointless-fun\n=============\n\nThis is a simple package and should
  be easy to install. You should\nbe able to use one of the following standard methods
  to install it.\n\n    -- With cabal-install and without the source:\n    $> cabal
  install pointless-fun\n    \n    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:\n
  \   $> cd pointless-fun\n    $> cabal install\n    \n    -- Without cabal-install,
  but with the source already:\n    $> cd pointless-fun\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  configure --user\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register\n\nThe test step is optional and currently
  does nothing. The Haddock\nstep is also optional.\n\n\nPortability\n===========\n\nAn
  attempt has been made to keep this library as portable as possible.\nIt is fully
  Haskell98 compliant.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------
