synopsis: bindings for Griffin PowerMate USB
changelog: ! "-*- Text -*-\n\n1.0\n\n* Now works with GHC 7.2.2 - 8.0.1.\n\n* Added
  Eq, Ord, Show, and Read instances for Event and Status.\n\n* Added example programs
  powermate-print and powermate-pulse.\n\n* Added documentation.\n\n* An open PowerMate
  is now represented by the opaque type 'PowerMate'\n  instead of 'Handle'.  A new
  function 'closeDevice' exists to close\n  the opaque 'PowerMate' type.\n\n* Fixed
  a bug where the PowerMate would get confused and start\n  dropping button presses
  if you set the LED.\n\n* Removed extraneous printing to stdout.\n\n* Removed getUSBName
  and readEventWithSkip; I didn't see the utility\n  in these functions.\n\n* readEvent
  no longer returns a Maybe.  There was no meaning to\n  'Nothing' and it just had
  to be ignored.\n\n* Removed the MPD module.  It wasn't directly related to the PowerMate\n
  \ functionality, and the \"libmpd\" package seems to be an alternative\n  which
  is more complete and better maintained.\n\n0.1  @  Sun Feb 24 16:34:18 UTC 2008\n\n*
  Initial release.\n"

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ppelleti/powermate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ppelleti/powermate)


  This library is for interfacing the [Griffin PowerMate USB][1] with

  Haskell on Linux.  Besides reading events from the PowerMate, you

  can also control the brightness, pulse speed, and pulse waveform of

  the built-in LED.


  ([An earlier version of the library][4] also contained an

  implementation of the [MPD][2] protocol.  This was removed, because it

  wasn''t directly related to the PowerMate functionality, and the

  [libmpd][3] library seems to be an alternative which is more complete

  and better maintained.)


  Besides the library, this package includes two example programs,

  `powermate-print` and `powermate-pulse`.  `powermate-print` simply

  prints out the events it receives from the PowerMate.

  `powermate-pulse` lets you control the LED pulse speed by

  turning the knob, and change the pulse waveform by clicking the knob.
