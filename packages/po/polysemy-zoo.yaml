  ## Overview

  The `polysemy-zoo` is an experimental repository for user-contributed additions
  to the `polysemy` ecosystem. You're encouraged to open Pull Requests here for
  any effects/interpretations that you write and think might be useful for others.

  Particularly successful contributions here will be migrated into either
  `polysemy` proper, or `polysemy-contrib` (the less experimental version of the
  zoo.)
