description: |-
  In PostgreSQL, the @COPY@ statement [1] provides a fast way to perform bulk
  insertion and retrieval.  To use @COPY ... FROM@ for bulk insertion, the
  data must first be converted to a special CSV-like format.

  This package provides basic support for converting data to the format
  needed by @COPY ... FROM@.  However, it does not provide the inverse
  operation (namely, reading data produced by @COPY ... TO@), nor does it
  support formatting customizations (what delimiter to use, how to represent
  NULL, etc.).
