  ## openFreePort


  This is another version of `warp`''s `openFreePort` function. Nice if you don''t
  already depend on `warp`.


  `openFreePort` returns a socket on random port and the port it has been bound to.


  ```haskell

  openFreePort :: IO (Int, Socket)

  ```


  ## wait


  `wait` will attempt to connect to a host and port until successful. Between each
  unsuccessful attempt it sleeps for 10 ms


  Here is an example of the primary function:


  ```haskell

  import Network.Socket.Wait (wait)


  void $ forkIO $ Warp.run 7000 app

  -- Wait for the server to start listening on the socket

  wait "127.0.0.1" 7000

  -- Communicate with the server

  ...

  ```


  In bash one could write:


  ```bash

  while ! nc -z localhost 7000 ; do sleep 0.01 ; done

  ```
