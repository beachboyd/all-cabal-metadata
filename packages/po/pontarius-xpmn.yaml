description: ! 'Pontarius XPMN aims to be an efficient and easy-to-use XPMN library
  for Haskell.

  This project was "forked" from Pontarius Media Server 1.0 Alpha 1 since we

  wanted to make our XPMN module available to other projects as well.


  Pontarius XPMN is still prototyped but it''s maturing rapidly.


  Please note that we are not recommending anyone to use Pontarius XPMN at this

  time as itâ€™s still in an experimental stage and will have its API and data types

  modified frequently. That being said, if you are interested to use Pontarius

  XPMN anyway, feel free to contact the Pontarius project and we will try to help

  you get started. Also, see the Examples directory for an example on how devices

  are currently implemented.


  We are currently working on cleaning up the API and securing client-to-client

  communications.


  We will release the next version, 1.0 Alpha 2, on the 4th of May.


  Look at the Pontarius web site <http://www.pontarius.org/>, the Pontarius XPMN

  web page <http://www.pontarius.org/projects/pontarius-xpmn/> and the Pontarius

  XPMN Hackage page <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pontarius-xpmn/> for more

  information.
