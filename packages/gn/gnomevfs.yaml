description: ! 'GNOME VFS is the GNOME virtual file system.  It is the foundation
  of the

  Nautilus file manager.  It provides a modular architecture and ships with

  several modules that implement support for local files, http, ftp and others.

  It provides an URI-based API, a backend supporting asynchronous file

  operations, a MIME type manipulation library and other features.'
