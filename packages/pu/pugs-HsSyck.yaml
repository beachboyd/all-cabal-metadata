description: ! 'This is a simple YAML (''Yet Another Markup Language'') processor,

  used by the Pugs project for handling data serialization; this can be

  useful for optimization and caching purposes.


  This is an interface to the @syck@ C library for parsing and

  dumping YAML data. It lets you transform textual YAML data into an

  object of type ''YamlNode'', and vice versa, fast.

  Note: This is an old HsSyck, as it was used by Pugs (''pugs-HsSyck''). You probably
  want

  the more updated HsSyck, available at <http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HsSyck>.'
