synopsis: Datatypes used by the Pushbullet APIs
changelog: ! "# Revision history for pushbullet-types\n\n## 0.4.0.2  -- 2018-02-11\n\n*
  Derive `ToHttpApiData` for `PushId`.\n\n## 0.4.0.1  -- 2018-02-08\n\n* Drop upper
  bounds on dependencies.\n\n## 0.4.0.0  -- 2017-08-01\n\n* Make `body` field of link
  pushes optional. Many channel pushes do not include\n  a body, but only the URL
  and the title.\n* Improve `Push` parsing. Push sender and receiver information are
  factored out\n  into separate datatypes, and parsed as a whole. Either you have
  a full sender\n  (either a client or a channel) or you don't have any of its fields.
  \ Same\n  applies to receivers, except that only clients can be receivers, and don't\n
  \ have names. This fixes a bug where pushes sent by channels could not be\n  parsed,
  since such pushes omit certain fields, such as `sender_iden` and\n  `sender_email`.\n\n##
  0.3.0.0  -- 2017-07-29\n\n* `PushEphemeral` now supports the `targets` field, which
  allows to more\n  faithfully parse clipboard synchronization messages in the realtime
  event\n  stream.\n* Missing `Eq` and `Show` instances for `Ephemeral` are now derived.\n*
  Missing device-related datatypes and constructors are now exported.\n* Values commonly
  used by PushBullet for the DeviceIcon type now have a bunch\n  of constants exported
  for them.\n* Aeson version upper bound is now higher; this version of pushbullet-types\n
  \ will now build with Stackage resolver lts-9.0.\n* Misc code cleanup.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  \ -- 2017-04-30\n\n* Some fields in `PushData` are now made optional, since the
  objects received\n  from Pushbullet may have them missing.\n* A minimum value for
  `PushbulletTime` is added. This is just zero seconds\n  since the POSIX epoch.\n*
  Ephemerals are reworked. Now `Ephemeral` actually has one constructor per\n  ephemeral
  type, and the previous constructors of `Ephemeral` are moved into\n  `PushEphemeral`.
  `Ephemeral` now has a constructor for tickles and nops.\n  Only push-type tickles
  have a dedicated constructor in `TickleType`.\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-02-20\n\nDefine
  the following core types:\n\n* `Push` -- messages used internally in Pushbullet.\n*
  `Ephemeral` -- messages sent directly into the live event stream. These have\n  a
  multitude of uses, e.g. sending SMS via a phone or seeing whether\n  notifications
  have occurred on a device.\n* `Device` -- representation of a device.\n* `User`
  -- representation of a user.\n* `Permanant` -- this is an undocumented type in the
  Pushbullet API. Notably,\n  SMS threads and messages are permanents.\n\nSome of
  these types come in two flavors: `New` and `Existing`. This is\nsignalled by a type
  index coming from a datakind.\n"
