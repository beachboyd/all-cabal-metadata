  # FAQ


  ## Why not just use Haddock?


  Haddock provides a great interface for writing API documentation, which is a kind
  of *hard documentation*.

  Newcomers from other languages are used to have a website per library, but sometimes
  this gets uncomfortable,

  as maintaining a documentation website is more work for the author.


  Tintin helps with this problem, as you get styling and organization for free. You
  just have to write your

  documentation using Markdown.


  The website generation is focused towards guides and tutorials, helping your users
  understand how to use your

  package easily.


  ## Why not using ReadTheDocs or GitBook?


  ReadTheDocs and GitBook are well established solutions for documentation, but they
  don''t provide automatic

  compilation and evaluation of Haskell code. This is error prone and can lead to
  confuse your users.


  Tintin is tightly integrated with Haskell and its tools, helping you to document
  your library in a very easy

  way.
