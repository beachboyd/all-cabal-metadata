description: ! "# timezone-olson\n\nOn Hackage: [timezone-olson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson)\n\nThis
  package provides a parser and renderer for binary Olson timezone\nfiles whose format
  is specified by the tzfile(5) man page on Unix-like\nsystems. For more information
  about this format, see\n[the IANA timezone database site](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).\n\nFunctions
  are provided for\nconverting the parsed data into `TimeZoneSeries` objects from
  the\n[timezone-series](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-series)\npackage.
  On many platforms, binary Olson timezone\nfiles suitable for use with this package
  are available in the\ndirectory `/usr/share/zoneinfo` and its subdirectories on
  your computer.\n\nSee also the\n[timezone-olson-th](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson-th)\npackage
  for a way to include timezone informaton from a binary Olson\ntimezone file at compile
  time.\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2018 Yitzchak Gale. All rights reserved.\n\nFor licensing
  information, see the BSD3-style license in the file\nLICENSE that was originally
  distributed by the author together with\nthis file.\n\nThis package is part of the
  [time-ng project](http://projects.haskell.org/time-ng/).\n\n## Testing utilities\n\nThis
  package also provides two Haskell files, each of which can be\ncompiled into a command-line
  utility that might be helpful for testing\npurposes.\n\nzhdump.hs: A clone of zdump(8),
  including most of its bugs, that\n           is usually present on systems that
  have an Olson timezone\n           database, except hzdump takes paths to timezone
  files\n           instead of timezone identifiers on the command line.\n\ncatTZ:
  \    Read and parse a timezone file, then render it. With the\n           -i flag,
  interprets the timezone data as a TimeZoneSeries\n           object before rendering.\n"
