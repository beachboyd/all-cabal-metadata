description: ! 'This library provides a timer wheel data structure for


  * /O(1)/ registering @IO@ actions to fire after a given amount of time

  * /O(1)/ canceling registered actions


  It is similar to @TimerManager@ from "GHC.Event", but can scale much better

  under concurrent access patterns.


  An unreleased version of this library has a @backpack@-based signature for

  selecting from a variety of different data structures used internally.

  However, until @backpack@ has broader support on Hackage, and in Haddocks,

  etc, I decided to just hard-code something decent (a priority search queue).

  This makes the @O(1)@ claims above a bit of a lie, as these rely on using a

  linked list data structure internally.'
