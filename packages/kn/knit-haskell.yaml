synopsis: a minimal Rmarkdown sort-of-thing for haskell, by way of Pandoc
changelog: "v0.7.0.0\n* Updated vega versions in pandoc templates\n* removed (internal)
  datadir function because we now use the function\nfrom the autogenerated ```Paths_knit-haskell```
  module.  Which has its own\ncomplications but the other version didn't work at all.\n*
  Added more constraints to Knit.Report.KnitEffects to simplify things.  \nIf you
  use them to constrain a function to procuce something that can be knitted\nyou will
  have all the knit effects available.\n* Where possible changed package bounds to
  >= A.B.C && < D.E. Most were already and\nsome were easy to change.  There are some
  lower bounds that are more specific and I\nwon't generalize those unless I test
  them.\n* Changed bounds for hvega, polysemy and polysemy-zoo. Downstream changes
  to account for this.\n* SimpleExample now uses default template so that it also
  serves as a test that default templates are found.\n\n\nv 0.6.0.1 - (Released 2019-06-21)\n*
  Moved the Pandoc default templates so they will be installed where Pandoc expects
  them. This is hard to test!\n\nv 0.6.0.0 - (Released: 2019-06-19)\n* updated to
  use polysemy-zoo version of constraint absorbers in PandocMonad.\n* Hackage download
  should now include templates and associated css\n* Added mkPandocWriterConfig and
  addCss function in Knit.Report.Output to handle loading things in \nthe included
  directory, which may be installed in a platform independent way.\n* Added two more
  html templates, pandoc-bootstrap-KH.html and pandoc-adaptive-bootstrap-KH.html\nwith
  pandoc-bootstrap.css and used them in some of the examples.\n* Added the default
  html templates into the pandoc-templates directory where Pandoc will expect\nthem
  if the given template fails.\n* Reorganized data directory with \"pandoc-data\"
  \"knit-haskell-templates\" and \"knit-haskell-css\"\n* Added output helpers for
  Pandoc results which are lazy text (html).  These create the\nrequired parent directories
  if necessary. See examples for details.\n* Removed ```Knit.Effect.RandomFu``` and
  modified the example which uses it to use the\n\"polysemy-RandomFu\" package instead.\n\nv
  0.5.0.0\n* Added plots example back since there is a version of plots on hackage
  with \na relaxed upper bound on containers.\n* Changed the Doc effect so that instead
  of Text name, it carries a polymorphic info type.  \nThis is then specified in the
  Pandoc case to be a Text name and set of template var overrides.\nThis creates several
  other changes and will break any multi-doc examples since now \n\"newPandoc\" takes
  a first argument of the type ```PandocInfo``` (which is just a \nproduct of a ```Text```
  and a ```Map String String```).\n* raised lower bound and relaxed upper bound on
  polysemy\n\nv 0.4.0.0 \n* Added  \n```absorbPandocMonad :: PandocEffects r => (forall
  m. PandocMonad m => m a) -> Sem r a``` \nto ```Knit.Effect.PandocMonad```\n* Removed
  (orphan) instances: ```PandocMonad (Sem r)``` and \n```MonadError PandocError (Sem
  r)``` in favor  of using \n```absorbPandocMonad``` when required.\n* Deprecated
  name \"Random\" in favor of \"RandomFu\" for clarity and \neventual consistency
  with Polysemy\n* Added \n```absorbMonadRandom :: Member RandomFu r => (forall m.
  MonadRandom m => m a) -> Sem r a``` \nto allow some\ninteroperation with actions
  constrained by ```MonadRandom```\n* Removed orphan ```Random.MonadRandom``` instance
  from \n```Knit.Effect.RandomFu``` because orphan instances are bad.\n* Changed return
  type of ```Knit.Report.knitError``` to ```Sem r a``` \n(from ```Sem r ()```)\n*
  Bumped lower bound on polysemy-plugin (because of a buggy version)\n* Bumped lower
  bound on polysemy\n* Removed plots example in \"SimpleExample\" and added a diagrams
  one.  \nWill add plots back once a version issue  with containers is resolved.\n\nv
  0.3.0.1\n* Examples were \"executables\" and are now \"tests\" so that depending
  on \nknit-haskell does not pull in the dependencies of the examples.\n\nv 0.3.0.0
  \n* Added exports of \"Colonnade\" and \"Text.Blaze.Colonnade\" to \n\"Knit.Report.Input.Table.Colonnade\"\n*
  Added \"knitError\" function to Knit.Report to allow user throwing of errors.  \nThese
  will become PandocSomeError and handled as a PandocError.\n* Lowered bound on containers
  (to 0.5.0) to accomodate use of Plots.\n* Added Knit.Report.Input.Visualization.Diagrams.
  \ \nAdds Diagrams from diagrams-lib via SVG backend.\n* Added some more re-exports
  (Colonnade, Diagrams.Prelude) \nfrom Knit.Report to simplify imports on use.\n*
  Added an optional figure caption argument to Hvega and Diagrams inputs. \n(this
  is a breaking change since it requires another argument).\n* Added a state effect
  wrapper to facilitate getting unused ids for figures, etc.\n* Changed id argument
  for Hvega and Diagrams \nvisualizations to \"Maybe Text\" from Text.  \nWill use
  built-in facilities for unique ids when set to Nothing.\n* Visualization \"addXXX\"
  functions now return the figure id (as \"Sem r Text\") \nso it can be referred to
  elsewhere.\n* Added KnitOne and KnitMany constraint-type-aliases to Knit.Report
  \nto simplify constraining doc producing functions.\n* Updated examples.  Added
  a diagrams example to SimpleExample \nand fixed id and caption arguments throughout.\n*
  Bumped upper bounds (network)\n\nv 0.2.0.0\n* Documentation Fixes\n* Added export
  of newPandoc and NamedDoc to Knit.Report to \nfacilitate multi-doc use.\n* Removed
  redundant imports from Knit.Report.Input.Table.Colonnade\n* Added a multi-doc example\n*
  (internal) Removed odd, and no longer necessary, \"LastMember\" \nconstraint from
  knit functions. \n* Updated effects for polysemy 1.2\n\nv 0.1.0.0  \n* Initial version\n\n"

description: "# knit-haskell v0.7.0.0\n\n[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]\n[![Hackage][hackage-badge]][hackage]\n[![Hackage
  Dependencies][hackage-deps-badge]][hackage-deps]\n\n## Introduction\nknit-haskell
  is an attempt to emulate parts of the RMarkdown/knitR experience in haskell. \nThe
  idea is to be able to build HTML (or, perhaps, some other things [Pandoc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc)
  can write) \ninside a haskell executable.  \nThis package has some wrapping around
  Pandoc and the [PandocMonad](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-2.7.2/docs/Text-Pandoc-Class.html#t:PandocMonad)
  \nas well as logging facilities \nand some support for inserting [hvega](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hvega)
  visualizations.  \nAll of that is handled via writer-like effects, so additions
  to the documents can be interspersed with regular haskell code.\n\n## Supported
  Inputs\n* [markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)\n* HTML ([blaze](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html),
  [lucid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid) or Text)\n* [latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)\n*
  [colonnade tables](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/colonnade)\n* [hvega](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hvega)
  visualizations (via [blaze](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html) HTML)
  \n* [Diagrams](https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) (via
  Diagrams SVG backend, inserted as HTML) \n\n## Examples\nThere are a few examples
  in the \"examples\" directory.  \n* [SimpleExample](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/examples/SimpleExample.hs)
  \ndemonstrates the bare bones features of the library.  Creating a document from
  a few fragments and then \n\"knitting\" it into HTML text and writing that to a
  file. This includes hvega, diagrams and plots examples.\n* [MultiDocExample](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/examples/MultiDocExample.hs)
  \ndemonstrates how to build multiple documents.\n* [MtlExample](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/examples/MtlExample.hs)
  \ndemonstrates the same simple features as above, but runs them atop an example
  mtl stack, \nallowing access to the mtl stack's functionality during document assembly.\n*
  [RandomExample](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/examples/RandomExample.hs)
  \nbuilds on the mtl example to show how you can also add an additional polysemy
  effect (in this case, \nPolysemy.RandomFu from [polysemy-RandomFu](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-RandomFu))\nto
  your document-building. \nThis one also demonstrates a use of [colonnade](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/colonnade)
  \nfor adding a formatted table to the document.\n* [ErrorExample](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/examples/ErrorExample.hs).
  \ \nSimilar to \"SimpleExample\" but throws a user error during document assembly.\n\n##
  Notes\n* You should be able to get everything you need by just importing the \n[Knit.Report](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/src/Knit/Report.hs)
  \nmodule.  That has the main functions for \"knitting\" documents from fragments
  \nand re-exports all the required functions to input the supported fragment types
  and create/write Html.\n* This uses [polysemy](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy#readme)
  for its effect management rather than mtl.  \nPolysemy's inference and performance
  are greatly improved if you enable the [polysemy-plugin](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-plugin),\nwhich
  involves:\n1. adding \"polysemy-plugin\" in build-depends and\n2. Add \"ghc-options:
  -fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin\" to your package configuration.\nPandoc effects and writer
  effects for document building are also provided.\n* Polysemy is capable of \"absorbing\"
  some mtl-style monad constraints.  This is demonstrated in\n[RandomExample](https://github.com/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell/blob/master/examples/RandomExample.hs#L113)
  and\ncomposable absorbers for MonadReader, MonadWriter, MonadState and MonadError\ncan
  be found in the [polysemy-zoo](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy-zoo).\n* Pandoc
  templates are included for HTML output.  See the examples for how to access them\nor
  specify others.\n* If you use knit-haskell via an installed executable, it will
  find the templates that \ncabal installs.  But if you use from a local build directory
  and use \"cabal new-\" or \"cabal v2-\"\nstyle commands, you will need to run the
  executable via some \"cabal v2-\" command as well, e.g.,\n\"cabal v2-run\" otherwise
  the templates--installed in the nix-style-build store--won't be found.\n* Though
  you can theoretically output to any format Pandoc can \nwrite--and it would be great
  to add some output formats!--some \nfeatures only work with some output formats.
  \nMy goal was the production of Html and that is the only output format that supports
  the hvega charting \nsince hvega itself is just a wrapper that builds javascript
  to render in a browser.  \nAnd so far that is the only supported output format.\n\n*
  This is very much a WIP. So it's rough around the edges and in the middle.  If you
  find it useful but have suggestions, please submit issues on github.\n* I'm very
  interested in adding to the \"zoo\" of input fragments.  Any PRs of that sort would
  be most welcome!\n* I'm also interested in widening the possible output types--currently
  only HTML is supported--but \nthat is quite limited now by hvega which only works
  in html output.  \nBut support could be added for other output types if hvega input
  is not required.\n\n\n[travis]:        <https://travis-ci.org/adamConnerSax/knit-haskell>\n[travis-badge]:
