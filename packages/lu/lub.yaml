description: ! 'Lub is an experiment in computing least upper information bounds on

  (partially defined) functional values.  It provides a ''lub'' function

  that is consistent with the ''unamb'' operator but has a more liberal

  precondition.  Where ''unamb'' requires its arguments to equal when

  neither is bottom, ''lub'' is able to synthesize a value from the

  partial information contained in both of its arguments.


  This module also defines ''glb'', which intersects information.
