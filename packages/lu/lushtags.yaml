description: ! "lushtags\n========\n\nCreate ctags compatible tags files for Haskell
  programs\n\nSimilar programs are [hasktags][1], [gasbag][2], [hothasktags][3], and
  GHC's\nbuiltin ctags generation.\n\nlushtags differs from these by being designed
  to have smooth integration with\nthe [Vim Tagbar][4] plugin.\n\nTagbar is nice because
  it deals with creating tags automatically. There is no\nneed to manually run commands
  or keep track of tag files. Just open any Haskell\nfile in Vim and the Tagbar window
  will instantly show an interactive browsable\nlist of all the functions and declarations
  in the file. This window also\nupdates automatically as you edit the file.\n\nThe
  tags created by lushtags are marked with several extensions, so that when\nused
  with Tagbar you get these features:\n\n- Type signatures are displayed for functions.\n-
  Tags are properly scoped so that, for example, data declarations appear as a\n  tree
  with their constructors scoped as children.\n- Definitions that are exported from
  the module are marked as \"public\" and\n  appear emphasized in Tagbar.\n- Tag locations
  are internally stored as patterns, not line numbers, so that\n  you can correctly
  jump to tags even if they have moved in the source code\n  during editing.\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/bitc/lushtags/raw/master/doc/screenshot-tagbar-2011-09-19.png)\n\n[1]:

  lushtags with Vim and the Tagbar plugin\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1.
  Build and install the lushtags executable\n\n    $ cabal configure\n    $ cabal
  build\n    $ cabal install\n\n2. Install the Tagbar plugin. Tagbar can be found
  at\n\n    <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465>  \n    <http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/>\n\n3.
  Install the included Haskell Tagbar configuration:\n\n    $ cp util/tagbar-haskell.vim
  ~/.vim/plugin/\n\n4. Try it out:\n\n    $ vim Hello.hs\n\nNow open the Tagbar with
  the command `:TagbarOpen`. An interactive sidebar will\nappear with all of the tags
  in your Haskell source file.\n"
