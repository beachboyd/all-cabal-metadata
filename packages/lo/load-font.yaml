description: ! "* Load Font\n  This library aims to a cross-platform (Win/Lin/OSX)
  way to load a custom font bundled with your Haskell app. The font is automatically
  unloaded when the app exits.\n\n  It ships with the [[https://www.dafont.com/moon-phases.font][Moon
  Phases]] font and a GUI demo, ~load-font-exe~ that uses the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs][FLTKHS]]
  Haskell GUI library to show that Moon Phases is indeed loaded. It has been tested
  on Arch Linux, Windows 10 and OSX Sierra.\n\n  While the demo uses FLTKHS font loading
  and unloading it is agnostic to the GUI framework. FLTKHS is used here simply because
  it's the easiest to build and install.\n\n  This library owes its existence to [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fltkgeneral/uAdg8wOLiMk/_CzBu995AwAJ][Albrecht
  Schlosser's post on the FLTK mailing list]].\n\n  To run the demo, clone this repo
  and do:\n  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n  > stack build --flag fltkhs:bundled\n  > stack exec
  load-font-exe\n  #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n [[file:screenshot-demo.jpg]]\n"
