  ---

  ## 1.3.3 -- 2018-09-30

  ### Other Changes

  * Support `stm-2.5`.
  * Support `base-4.12`.

  ---

  ## 1.3.2 -- 2018-07-06

  ### Other Changes

  * Support `free-5.1`.

  ---

  ## 1.3.1

  * Add `MonadUnliftIO` instance for `LoggingT`.

  ---

  # 1.3.0

  ## Major Changes

  * Switch from `wl-pprint-text` to `prettyprinter`.

  ## Other changes

  * Change the type of the `ribbonFrac` parameter of `withFDHandler`
    from `Float` to `Double` to reflect the underlying `prettyprinter`
    API.

  ---

  # 1.2.6

  ## Other Changes

  * Increased upper bound of `base` and support GHC 8.4.

  ---

  # 1.2.5

  ## Other Changes

  * Increased upper bound of `exceptions`.

  ---

  # 1.2.4

  ## Other Changes

  * Increased upper bound of `exceptions`.

  ---

  # 1.2.3

  ## Other Changes

  * Increased upper of `async`.

  ---

  # 1.2.2

  ## Other Changes

  * Increased upper bound of `free` and `time`.

  ---

  # 1.2.1

  ## Other Changes

  * Increased upper bound of `base` to allow < 4.11.

  ---

  # 1.2.0

  ## Major Changes

  - `withFDHandler` now explicitly flushes the file handle whenever log entries
     are rendered out. Thanks to @filterfish for identifying this omission that
     could lead to log messages being dropped.

     Upgrade steps: no changes other than updating `logging-effect`.

  ---

  # 1.1.3

  ## Other Changes

  - Increased upper bound of `time` to allow < 1.9.

  ---

  # 1.1.2

  ## Other changes

  - Increased upper bound of `time`

  ---

  # 1.1.1

  - `withBatchedHandler` no longer prints empty log messages. Previously,
    if you ran a program that didn't log but used `withBatchedHandler` (or anything
    that used that), an empty log message would be output. Thanks to @codedmart
    for fixing this.

  ---

  # 1.1.0

  *Breaking changes*:

  - `MonadLog` no longer has `logMessage` as a function. It now has
    `logMessageFree` which takes a free monoid of log messages. If you were just
    using `logging-effect` then this won't affect you, as `logMessage` still exists
    with the same signature outside the type class.

  - `MonadLog` now comes with a law that states that logging is a monoid
    homomorphism. This essentially means that you have to treat all log messages
    uniformly.

  - Pass-through instances for all "stock" monad transformers have been added
    (all of `transformers`, `CatchT` from exceptions and `FreeT`/`FT` from `free`).

  - `WithSeverity` now has instances of `Traversable` and `Foldable`

  - `WithTimestamp` now has instances of `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read` and `Show`.

  *Additions*:

  - A set of convenience functions have been added for quickly logging with
    severity. The combinators are: `logDebug`, `logInfo`, `logNotice`,
    `logWarning`, `logError`, `logCritical`, `logAlert` and `logEmergency`.

  - `mapLogMessage` got a companion function `mapLogMessageM` that works with
    monadic tranformations.

  *Other*

  - Many documentation bug fixes.

  - INLINEABLE pragmas added.
