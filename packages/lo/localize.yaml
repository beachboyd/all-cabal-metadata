description: ! "localize README\n===============\n\nThis package is more or less fully
  functional translation framework,\nbased on [haskell-gettext][1] package. The key
  features are:\n\n* Convinient functions for translation.\n* Full support of gettext
  features, such as message contexts and plural forms.\n* It is possible to detect
  language to use by process locale. But it is not\n  necessary, you for example may
  want to use `Accept-Language` HTTP header\n  instead.\n* Easy integration with custom
  monadic stacks by implementing instance of\n  `Localized` type class.\n* There are
  two simple implementations of `Localized` type class, for IO and\n  StateT-based
  monad transformer. Being mostly examples, these implementations\n  can be useful
  in relatively simple applications.\n* Utility functions to locate catalog files
  by specified rules. Example rules\n  for locating catalog files under source directory
  and for locating them\n  under usual Linux locations are provided.\n* Integration
  with [text-format-heavy][2] package. It may be more convinient\n  than use of some
  other formatting libraries (`printf`, for example),\n  since it supports named variable
  placeholders, much easier for translators\n  to understand.\n\nPlease refer to Haddock
  documentation and to examples in `examples/` directory.\n\n[1]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gettext\n[2]:
