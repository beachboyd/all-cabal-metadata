description: ! 'WARNING: this is a research program

  written as I learn and explore /type inferencing/:

  please understand well by yourself whatever you may take from it;

  any question or contribution being welcome :-)


  This package implements /type inferencing/

  by manipulating /type constraints/

  through 3 successive phases:

  1. the ''Collect'' phase collects them from some expression,

  2. the ''Order'' phase modifies the order in which they will be solved,

  3. the ''Solver'' phase solves them according to the logic

  of some /type inference rules/.


  So far, the principles within these phases

  are mainly a rewrite of Bastiaan Heeren''s

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Top Top>,

  using my own code conventions and ideals of simplicity.

  The most notable change being the use of Roman Cheplyaka''s

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-classes monad-classes>

  (a little bit augmented):

  to handle the ''Monad'' stack building a ''Solver''

  (instead of a homegrown machinery I could not understand well).

  At this point, only a /bottom-up/ ''Collect'', a no-op ''Order''

  and a ''Greedy'' ''Solver'' are implemented, supporting:

  /monomorphic types/ (''Monotype''),

  /parametric polymorphism/ (''Polytype''),

  /type class polymorphism/ (''Class''),

  and /type synonyms/ (''Synotype'').

  The quite understandable thesis of Bastiaan Heeren

  explains a lot of this in details:

  <http://www.open.ou.nl/bhr/TopQuality.pdf Top Quality Type Error Messages>.


  The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uuagc Attribute Grammar System of Universiteit
  Utrecht>

  is used to demonstrate how to collect /type constraints/ from an expression (''Expr''),

  and then how to transform this /implicitely typed/ expression into an /explicitely
  typed/
