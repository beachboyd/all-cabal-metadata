synopsis: an adapter for LogicGrowsOnTrees that uses MPI
changelog: ! "Version 1.0.0.1\n===============\n\n* Improved performance.\n\n* Now
  notices are logged when workers connect and disconnect.\n\n* Exposed `getCurentStatistics`
  in the `RequestQueueMonad`, allowing one to\n  obtain the statistics at any time
  during the run.\n\n* Fixed the documentation.\n\n* Now ImplicitParams are used instead
  of a monad to ensure sockets\n  initialization.\n\n* Fixed bug where MPI was not
  geting initialized.\n\n* Bumped dependency bounds.\n\n* Lowered he lower bound on
  `stm` from 2.4 to 2.3.\n\n* Deleted vestigial import.\n"

  THIS ON HACKAGE then click here to browse the package reference documentation.>

  (The package unfortunately cannot be built on the Hackage server because

  MPI is not installed on it.)


  This package provides a adapter for the LogicGrowsOnTrees package that uses

  MPI for parallelism. See the module documentation for more details.


  NOTE:  You need to have an MPI implementation installed to use the package;

  no thread support is required, and it only uses very simple

  functionality so MPI 1.0 or 1.1 should suffice. Also, @mpi.h@ needs

  to be in the include path and a library named @mpi@ (@libmpi@ in

  unix) in the library path; if these files are not in their respective

  paths, you can add their directories to their respective search paths

  for this package by using Cabal''s respective

  @--extra-include-dirs=...@ and @--extra-lib-dirs=...@ options.'
