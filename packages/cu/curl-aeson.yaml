description: ! 'A library for communicating with JSON over HTTP connection.

  Supports rich set of HTTP connectivity features provided by

  libcurl combined to the performance and elegancy of aeson.


  All HTTP methods are supported. Instances of ''ToJSON'' and

  ''FromJSON'' typeclasses can be transferred via this library.

  Session cookies and other HTTP options may be passed to libcurl

  if needed.


  This library is at its best when communicating with simple,

  non-standardized JSON interfaces. If you are implementing

  JSON-RPC compliant client or server, take a look at

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jmacro-rpc>.'
