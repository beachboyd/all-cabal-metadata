description: ! 'This package provides two types for representing currencies, one that

  can only represent ISO4217 currencies, and one that can also represent

  nonstandard currencies.


  An IsString instance is provided for convenience on the general type.


  Instances of Eq, Ord, and, Hashable are provided for use as keys.


  The Enum instance provides a mapping to/from ISO4217 numeric codes for

  currencies that have such a code.'
