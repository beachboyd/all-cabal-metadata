description: ! 'This package provides the following:

  nested arrays and the primitive operators that work on them (PA functions);

  the lifted array combinators that the vectoriser introduces (PP functions);

  the user facing library functions that work on [::] style arrays (P functions).

  This implementation directly encodes sharing between array segments,

  and avoids the copying that dph-lifted-copy would otherwise do.

  Use this version for production code.'
