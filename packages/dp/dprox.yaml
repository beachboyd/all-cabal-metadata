  ## dprox

  dprox is a lightweight DNS proxy server. It's written as a drop-in replacement
  of dnsmasq to work with [dnsmasq-china-list](https://github.com/felixonmars/dnsmasq-china-list),
  while improving the lookup performance over large domain list.

  ### Installation

  Only Linux and macOS are supported. [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) is required to build `dprox`.

  ```sh
  stack install
  ```

  ### Usage

  Only a small subset of dnsmasq options are implemented, just barely enough to work with `dnsmasq-china-list`.

  Use `dprox --help` to list those options. A [systemd unit file](https://github.com/bjin/dprox/blob/master/systemd/dprox.service) is also provided for Linux user.

  ### Known Issue

  * `dprox` has fairly large memory footprint at the moment. Over 100MB for current `dnsmasq-china-list`.
