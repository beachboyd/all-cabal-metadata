description: ! 'This module provides a simple declarative framework for dynamic programming
  optimization.

  Users specify a dynamic programming problem as a simple haskell function that looks
  very similar to

  mathematical recursion used in texts. The specification is then translated into
  a form that can be

  solved efficiently by a modular solver. Includes solvers using memoization,

  strict and lazy ordered tables, and recursion with a range of data structures for
  the underlying table.

  This method also separates processing steps like pruning and debugging from the
  recursion itself, and

  this package contains preliminary tools for beam search and tracing.'
