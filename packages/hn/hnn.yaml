description: |2-

  A neural network library implemented purely in Haskell, relying on the
  hmatrix library.

  This library provides a straight and simple feed-forward neural networks implementation which
  is way better than the one in hnn-0.1, in all aspects.

  You can find a mini-tutorial in @AI.HNN.FF.Network@.
