changelog: ! "* 0.3.0.2 Libby Horacek <libby@positiondev.com> 2017-6-13\n\n  - Update
  base dependencies to support GHC 8\n  - Add a stack.yml for 8.15\n\n* 0.3.0.1.1
  David Hartunian <david@positiondev.com> 2017-6-30\n\n  - Add okJson helper for returning
  JSON strings as text\n\n* 0.3.0.1 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-3-11\n\n
  \ - Change repository location, copyright.\n\n* 0.3.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net>
  2016-3-2\n\n  - Don't parse request body by default, to make `Fn` play well with\n
  \   others (that want to parse the body themself).\n  - Add `!=>` connective that
  is like `==>`, but parses the request\n    body. If you don't use `!=>`, patterns
  with `file` and `files`\n    will fail. Also, `param` will only get query parameters.\n
  \ - Add `Route` type alias for the type of `pattern ==> handler`. This\n    is partly
  for convenience and partly to make upgrades easier (in\n    the event that the types
  change).\n  - Change `FromParam` class to take a list of all parameters matching\n
  \   a given name, which allows us to implement a `Maybe` instance, a\n    list instance,
  and make `paramMany` redundant (though currently\n    left in, for compatibility).
  This also makes the ergonomics of\n    using optional parameters better.\n  - Fix
  bug where `staticServe` would allow you to break out of\n    directory specified
  with `..`.\n\n* 0.2.0.2 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-1-20\n\n  - Fix
  for GHC 7.8, which cabal file said would work, but didn't.\n\n* 0.2.0.1 Daniel Patterson
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-12-4\n\n  - Fix bug in url routing where \"/foo/bar\", \"/foo/bar/\",
  and\n    \"/foo//bar\" were all treated differently.\n\n* 0.2.0.0 Daniel Pattersion
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-5\n\n  - Changed to having our own `FnRequest` type, which
  is a WAI\n    `Request` and the results of parsing the body for contents, since\n
  \   we need to be able to do that once and thread it through.\n  - Add `file` and
  `files` matchers, which match against and pass file\n    uploads to handlers.\n
  \ - Add `staticServe` to serve static files based on path.\n\n* 0.1.4.0 Daniel Pattersion
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-4\n\n  - Move `ctxt` back to first parameter passed to
  handlers, via more\n    continuations.\n\n* 0.1.3.1 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net>
  2015-10-31\n\n  - Add `method` matcher to match against HTTP method.\n\n* 0.1.3.0
  Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-30\n\n  - Allow nested calls to `route`,
  by changing `Request` in\n    `ctxt`. This necesitated changing it so that the `ctxt`
  is passed\n    to handlers _last_, instead of first, because we need to have\n    completed
  matching before we can change the request.\n  - Add `anything` route matcher that
  matches anything.\n  - Add `paramMany` matcher that returns a list of values for
  the\n    given query param.\n  - Change `param` to fail if more than one value is
  in query string.\n\n* 0.1.2.0 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-27\n\n
  \ - Rename `paramOptional` to `paramOpt`, to match `fn-extra`'s `Heist`\n    naming
  of `attr` and `attrOpt`.\n  - Remove `paramPresent`, because you\n    can get that
  behavior by parsing to `Text`.\n\n* 0.1.1.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-26\n\n
  \ - Rename `Param` class to `FromParam`.\n\n* 0.1.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net>
  2015-10-25\n\n  - Initial release.\n"
