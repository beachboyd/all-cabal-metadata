description: ! '# Elm Server


  This is a simple server to make it easier to develop Elm projects. It lets you

  view Elm files in your browser and recompile them by refreshing the page.


  #### Install


  It comes bundled with the Elm Platform or you can install it individually with

  `cabal install elm-server`.



  #### Use


  Navigate to the Elm project you want to work on. In that directory run:


  ```bash

  elm-server

  ```


  This will start the server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

  If you want to use a different port, use the `--port` flag (e.g. `elm-server

  --port 8080`). In your browser you can navigate through your project and see how

  each Elm page looks.


  `elm-server` will serve any kind of static content, so you can also look at HTML,

  images, JSON, or whatever else you may need to serve.
