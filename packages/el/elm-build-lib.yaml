description: ! 'This library provides both runtime and Template Haskell functions
  which let you take multi-module

  Elm Programs and compile them to JavaScript.

  The main goal of this is to allow Elm to be used as a frontend for Haskell servers
  or Web apps.

  The library is independent of any specific framework, so it should work with Yesod,
  Snap, Happstack, Scotty, etc.'
