description: ! 'This is the bytestring builder that is debuting in bytestring-0.10.4.0,
  which

  should be shipping with GHC 7.8, probably late in 2013.  This builder has

  several nice simplifications and improvements, and more out-of-box

  functionality than the older blaze-builder.


  Note that this package detects which version of bytestring you are compiling

  against,  and if you are compiling against bytestring-0.10.4 or later, will

  be an empty package.


  This package lets the new interface and implementation be used with most

  older compilers without upgrading bytestring, which can be rather

  problematic.  In conjunction with blaze-builder-0.4 or later,  which

  offers an implementation of blaze-builder in terms of bytestring-builder,

  this should let most people try the new interface and implementation without

  causing undue compatibility problems with packages that depend on

  blaze-builder.


  GHC 7.6 did debut an almost identical interface and implementation, but with

  slightly different module names and organization.   Trying to re-export/rename

  the builder provided with 7.6 did not turn out to be very practical,  because

  this interface includes new functions that rely on Builder internals,

  which are not exported in 7.6.  Furthermore, these module names should be

  deprecated in 7.10.'
