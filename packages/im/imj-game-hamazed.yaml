description: ! "# What is it?\n\nIt's a terminal ascii game where you fly a ship through
  numbers. The goal is to shoot\nthe numbers whose sum will be equal to the level's
  target. It's easy at the beginning,\nbut higher levels have more and more numbers,
  and less and less space to navigate through them!\nThe last level is level 12: I
  never reached it, but I hope somebody will :).\n\n# Demos\n\n## No walls, square
  world\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/151434.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/151434)\n\n##
  Random walls, rectangular world\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/151404.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/151404)\n\n#
  Configurability\n\nThe game can be configured in \"world shape\" (square, rectangle)
  and \"kind of walls\"\n(none, deterministic, random).\n\n![Configuration snapshot](images/config.png?raw=true
  \"Configuration\")\n\nYou can define your own keyboard mapping by modifying the
  'eventFromKey' function\ndefined [here](src/Game/Event.hs), the default mapping
  being:\n- ship acceleration : 's' 'e' 'd' 'f'\n- laser shots       : 'j' 'i' 'k'
  'l'\n\n# Supported Platforms / Terminals:\n\n|OS       |Support|\n|---------|-------|\n|OS
  X     |Yes    |\n|Linux    |Yes    |\n|Windows  |No (see [this](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7353))
  |\n\nYour terminal window should have a dimension of at least {height = 42, width
  = 146}.\nIf it is too small, the program will fail with the following error message:\n\n```\nFrom
  game thread:\n\nMinimum terminal size : Window {height = 42, width = 146}.\nCurrent
  terminal size : Window {height = 22, width = 165}.\nThe current terminal size doesn't
  match the minimum size,\nplease adjust your terminal size and restart the executable.\n```\n\n#
  Version history\n- 2.1 :\n  - New animations :\n    - With colors (8-bit)\n    -
  Also between levels\n    - Using physics and gravity\n    - \"Terminal size\"-aware\n-
  2.0 :\n  - World is configurable (square or rectangle, with or without random walls)\n
  \ - Explosion animations\n  - Optimized rendering (delta rendering)\n- 1.0 :\n  -
  The world is a square. (Note : ship acceleration was 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' at that time)\n\n#
  Build\n\nYou can build and run using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org):\n\n`stack
  build --pedantic && stack exec hamazed-exe`\n\n# Credits\n\n## Delta rendering\n\nThe
  initial idea for delta rendering is based on [code written by Rafael Ibraim](https://gist.github.com/ibraimgm/40e307d70feeb4f117cd)\n"
