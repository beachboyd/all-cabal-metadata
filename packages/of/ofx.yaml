description: ! 'A parser for Open Financial Exchange (OFX) financial data. This

  handles OFX version 1.03, which is documented at http://www.ofx.net

  This also handles QFX, which is OFX plus some minor additions made

  by Intuit, the publishers of Quicken.


  The parser will place all the data into a tree, which you can query

  for whatever data you may need, although you will need to be

  familiar with the OFX spec to do this. There is also a Transaction

  type which you can easily parse from the tree; this will contain

  most, perhaps all, of the data you will be interested in if your OFX

  file is from a bank or credit card account.


  All the OFX and QFX files I have seen use the format from the 1.0

  series of OFX, which is primarily SGML based. OFX version 2 is XML

  based.  This parser likely will not work on those files.'
