description: ! 'This is a framework for untyped, symbolic computations like a CAS

  does, without any baked-in rules whatsoever but the ability to

  define expressions very consisely, as well as any transformation

  rules you want. The idea is basically to combine the flexibility

  of a Lisp with the conciseness of a Regex engine, using syntax similar

  to Haskell''s standard pattern matching.'
