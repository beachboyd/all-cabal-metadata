synopsis: An implementation of the Dung argumentation frameworks.
changelog: ! "1.0.0.1 => 1.1\n==============\nThis package version is now compatible
  with the command-line application for \nthe ICCMA competition. See: https://github.com/nebasuke/DungICCMA
  and the\ncompetition website: http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/index.html\n\nThis
  package has again been significantly extended and now includes:\n\n* Strict version
  of the grounded fixpoint semantics.\n\n* Definitions of what it means to be a preferred
  and stable extension.\n\n* Naive implementations of complete, preferred and stable
  semantics using \n  the characteristic function. The fixpoint definitions are actually
  FASTER\n  than the fancy algorithm implementation. \n  \n* Included the fast implementations
  of intersect, nub and (\\\\) by Niklas \n  Hambuechen. \n  \n* Added some clarifying
  text for the \"complete\" labelling.\n\n\n1.0 => 1.0.0.1\n==============\n* Fixed
  the record declaration in Main.hs.\n\n* Added an example file.\n\n0.9 => 1.0\n=============\nThis
  package version is now compatible with the translation package CarneadesIntoDung.
  \nSee http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CarneadesIntoDung/\n\nThis package has
  furthermore been significantly extended and now includes:\n\n* Preferred, stable
  and semi-stable semantics along with all definitions from\n   Caminada's paper \"An
  Algorithm for Computing Semi-Stable Semantics\".\n\n* An Input module, allowing
  files in standard CEGARTIX/PrefSat format to be parsed.\n\n* An Output module, allowing
  AFs in this package to be outputted in standard\n  CEGARTIX/PrefSat format.\n\n*
  A main executable, allowing input files to be read, argumentation frameworks\n  to
  be outputted and evaluated."

description: ! 'An implementation of Dung''s argumentation frameworks, an abstract
  argumentation model used to either directly represent conflicting information, or
  used as

  a translation target for more complex (structured) argumentation models. For an
  introduction to Dung''s frameworks see

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework> and Dung''s paper from 1995:
  \"On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role

  in nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming, and n-person games\", Artificial Intelligence
  77: 321-357.

  For the papers accompanying this library see \"Towards a framework for the implementation
  and verification of translations between argumentation

  models\" and \"A principled approach to the implementation of argumentation models\",
