description: ! 'This library provides the ability to coordinate the remote ssh

  execution of commands on target nodes and display the results in a

  console interface.  The console interface can either be a cmdline

  (CLI) or a text interface (TUI), based on brick and vty; support is

  provided for extension to other UI components as well.


  Almost all of the functionality is provided in the library itself;

  it just needs an executable that will invoke it with the set of

  remote nodes.  See the ''GetRemotes.hs'' file for an example: remotes

  can be of any type that is an instance of @WorkEntry@ with an

  associated @WorkGroup@ grouping.


  There is an onrmttest executable built that showcases the

  functionality using ssh operations to localhost, and a

  corresponding onrmttestline executable that provides a simple CLI.'
