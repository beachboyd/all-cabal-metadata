description: ! "# one-line-aeson-text\n\n`one-line-aeson-text` is a very simply pretty-printer
  for [Aeson] values. It produces single-line output, which you may want for displaying
  short JSON data in log files. Our function output is similar to normal Aeson rendering,
  but we include spaces after comma and colon characters to produce text that is slightly
  more suitable for human consumption.\n\n  [Aeson]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson\n"
