description: ! 'This package provides a canonical anonymous 1-tuple type missing

  from Haskell for attaching typeclass instances.


  NOTE: There is also the </package/OneTuple OneTuple package> which

  by using a boxed @data@-type provides a 1-tuple type which has

  laziness properties which are more faithful to the ones of Haskell''s

  native tuples; whereas the primary purpose of ''Only'' is to

  provide the traditionally so named type-wrapper for attaching typeclass

  instances.'
