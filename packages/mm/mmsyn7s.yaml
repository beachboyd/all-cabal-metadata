  # Revision history for mmsyn7s

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-01-09

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-01-10

  * First version revised A. Added a function show7s2 for the usage in the mmsyn7ukr package.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-02-24

  * Second version. Added functions that can be used to divide a given text to parts with the unique Ukrainian sounds representations (except silent ones) and
  the rest of the text being represented. Changed code for mmsyn7s function for readability. Some minor documentation improvements.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version. Added README.markdown file. Added the analysis for the first command line argument. Added the possibility to process a Ukrainian text as a whole
  or alternatively by parts, each of which contains only unique String Ukrainian sounds representations (except for the silent ones). Some minor code and documentation
  improvements.

  ## 0.3.0.1 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version revised A. Improved formatting for the README.markdown file.

  ## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version revised B. Separated the "1" option into two different ones: "1" and "-1", each of which prints either a list of Strings or the rest of the text being
  treated partially till the first duplicated Ukrainian sound representation (except the silent ones). Improved formatting for the documentation.

  ## 0.3.1.1 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version revised C. Fixed issue with being not complete the "-h" first command line argument information.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-02-26

  * Fourth version. Fixed issue with the documentation for the 'show7s5' function. Added some new library functions. Added the possibility to get some statistic metrics
  and to obtain a list of lists of Strings -- the information about how many and what actually Ukrainian sounds representations are needed to be created if every sound
  representation is unique.

  ## 0.5.0.1 -- 2020-02-26

  * Fifth version revised A. Fixed issue with the duplicated record in the statistics. Improved formatting for the statistics printing by the program.

  ## 0.5.0.2 -- 2020-02-26

  * Fifth version revised B. Fixed issue with the version number.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2020-02-28

  * Sixth version. Added packages mmsyn2 and mmsyn5 as a dependencies explicitly (earlier they wele as implicit dependencies because they are dependencies for
  mmsyn6ukr). Added the module MMSyn7.Syllable and the instruments to work with syllables. Added ghc-options for mmsyn7s.cabal file. Added some performance
  improvements to the previous code. Some grammar issues fixed.

  ## 0.6.1.0 -- 2020-02-28

  * Sixth version revised A. Fixed issue with the not being compiled because of the deprecated information in the mmsyn7s.cabal file.

  ## 0.6.2.0 -- 2020-02-28

  * Sixth version revised B. Fixed issue with the not being compiled because of the wrong application of the function in the 'exceptRead' function.

  ## 0.6.3.0 -- 2020-02-28

  * Sixth version revised C. Fixed issue with the not being compiled because of the wrong application of the function in the 'takeWordS' function.

  ## 0.6.4.0 -- 2020-02-29

  * Sixth version revised D. Fixed issue with the 'notEqC' and respectively 'divideConsonants' functions. Added new functions to deal more with UZP datatype and so with
  classical sounds in the MMSyn7.Syllable module and respectively in the MMSyn7s and Main modules. Changed the behaviour for "-s2" first command line argument
  for mmsyn7s executable. Some minor documentation improvements.

  ## 0.6.5.0 -- 2020-03-01

  * Sixth version revised E. Improved the performance of the 'main7s' function for the "-s" first command line parameter.

  ## 0.6.5.1 -- 2020-03-01

  * Sixth version revised F. Improved formatting for the statistics printing for "-s" and "-s2" first command line arguments.

  ## 0.6.6.0 -- 2020-03-08

  * Sixth version revised G. Changed the import of the datatype 'UZP' from the module MMSyn7.Syllable.

  ## 0.6.7.0 -- 2020-05-14

  * Sixth version revised H. Changed the bounds for dependencies so that now also GHC 8.10* series are supported.

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2020-06-24

  * Seventh version. Changed Double to Float in the MMSyn7s module so that the functons can be consistent with new dobutokO packages. Besides, the double precision
  is not needed and in some cases is meaningless and can potentially (a little bit, however) reduce performance in some cases. Some minor code and documentation improvements.

  ## 0.8.0.0 -- 2020-08-16

  * Eighth version. Changed the import from MMSyn6Ukr.Show7s module and therefore the mmsyn6ukr dependency bounds.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2020-10-08

  * Ninth version. Added new functions to evaluate syllables durations.

description: "        ***** Usage *****\n        =================\n\nThe package
  provides library functions and an executable. The executable\ntakes the first command
  line argument and (may be) a Ukrainian text\nbeing written without quotes as the
  next command line arguments\nand prints the sorted list of the Ukrainian sounds
  representations\n(or something equivalent, see command line arguments) that can
  be used\nfurther in mmsyn7 series of programs (or independently).\n\nDepending on
  the first command line argument the program behaves as follows:\n\n\"-h\" -- prints
  help and exits;\n\n\"-s\" -- prints some general descriptive statistics metrices
  for the given text;\n\n\"-s2\" -- prints syllable segmentation for the {number of
  words\n(or their parts) to be taken for statistics, which is a second\ncommand line
  argument} and some information about its structure\nthat can be interesting;\n\n\"-v\"
  -- prints version number and exits;\n\n\"-1\" -- prints the rest of the text after
  the first duplicated sound\nrepresentation (except silent ones) including it with
  whitespaces and\nsome phonetical conversions; \n\n\"0\"  -- prints the list of String
  for the whole text.\n\n\"1\"  -- prints the list of String being unique (without
  silence);\n\n\"2\"  -- prints the list of String for the whole text where every
  sound\nrepresentation is unique; \n\n\"3\"  -- prints the list of lists of Strings
  for the whole text, which\nshows what sounds representations are needed to be created
  if every\nsound representation is unique;\n\nAll other variants of the beginning
  for the command line arguments\nare the same as \"0\" (the arguments are treated
  as a Ukrainian text\nand processed as a whole one object).\n\n                  *****
  Syllable Segmentation *****\n                  =================================\n\nThe
  program (and the library) can be used to obtain information about\nsyllable segmentation
  of the Ukrainian text. For more information,\nplease, refer to the above information
  about the \"-s2\" first command\nline argument and to the documentation for the
  MMSyn7.Syllable module.\n\n ________________\n\nThe resulting Strings and lists
  of Strings can be used further in the\nprograms:\n\n[mmsyn7ukr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr)\n\n[mmsyn7h](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7h)\n\nThe
  results of the previous ones can be processed also by the program: \n\n[mmsyn7l](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7l)\n"
