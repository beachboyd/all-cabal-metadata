description: "        ***** Usage *****\n        -----------------\n\nThe package
  provides a library functions and the executable. The executable\ntakes the first
  command line argument and (may be) a Ukrainian text\nbeing written without quotes
  as the next command line arguments\nand prints the sorted list of the Ukrainian
  sounds representations\nthat can be used further in mmsyn7 series of programs.\n\nDepending
  on the first command line argument the program behaves as follows:\n\n\"-h\" --
  prints help and exits;\n\n\"-v\" -- prints version number and exits;\n\n\"1\"  --
  prints the list of String being unique (without silence) and then\nthe rest of the
  text with whitespaces;\n\n\"0\"  -- prints the list of String for the whole text.\n\nAll
  other variants of the beginning for the command line arguments\nare the same as
  \"0\" (the arguments are treated as a Ukrainian text\nand processed as a whole one
  object).        \n\nThe resulting Strings and lists of Strings can be used further
  in the\nprograms:\n\n[mmsyn7ukr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr)\n\n[mmsyn7h](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7h)\n\nThe
  results of the previous ones can be processed also by the program: \n\n[mmsyn7l](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7l)\n"
