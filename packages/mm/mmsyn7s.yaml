  # Revision history for mmsyn7s

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-01-09

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-01-10

  * First version revised A. Added a function show7s2 for the usage in the mmsyn7ukr package.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-02-24

  * Second version. Added functions that can be used to divide a given text to parts with the unique Ukrainian sounds representations (except silent ones) and
  the rest of the text being represented. Changed code for mmsyn7s function for readability. Some minor documentation improvements.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version. Added README.markdown file. Added the analysis for the first command line argument. Added the possibility to process a Ukrainian text as a whole
  or alternatively by parts, each of which contains only unique String Ukrainian sounds representations (except for the silent ones). Some minor code and documentation
  improvements.

  ## 0.3.0.1 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version revised A. Improved formatting for the README.markdown file.

  ## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version revised B. Separated the "1" option into two different ones: "1" and "-1", each of which prints either a list of Strings or the rest of the text being
  treated partially till the first duplicated Ukrainian sound representation (except the silent ones). Improved formatting for the documentation.

  ## 0.3.1.1 -- 2020-02-25

  * Third version revised C. Fixed issue with being not complete the "-h" first command line argument information.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-02-26

  * Fourth version. Fixed issue with the documentation for the 'show7s5' function. Added some new library functions. Added the possibility to get some statistic metrics
  and to obtain a list of lists of Strings -- the information about how many and what actually Ukrainian sounds representations are needed to be created if every sound
  representation is unique.

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2020-02-26

  * Fifth version. Added a function 'show7s9' and some descriptive statistics functions. For the first command line argument "-s" the program now prints some
  descriptive statistics metrices for the given text.

description: "        ***** Usage *****\n        -----------------\n\nThe package
  provides a library functions and the executable. The executable\ntakes the first
  command line argument and (may be) a Ukrainian text\nbeing written without quotes
  as the next command line arguments\nand prints the sorted list of the Ukrainian
  sounds representations\nthat can be used further in mmsyn7 series of programs.\n\nDepending
  on the first command line argument the program behaves as follows:\n\n\"-h\" --
  prints help and exits;\n\n\"-s\" -- prints some general descriptive statistics metrices
  for the given text; \n\n\"-v\" -- prints version number and exits;\n\n\"-1\" --
  prints the rest of the text after the first duplicated sound\nrepresentation (except
  silent ones) including it with whitespaces and\nsome phonetical conversions; \n\n\"0\"
  \ -- prints the list of String for the whole text.\n\n\"1\"  -- prints the list
  of String being unique (without silence);\n\n\"2\"  -- prints the list of String
  for the whole text where every sound\nrepresentation is unique; \n\n\"3\"  -- prints
  the list of lists of Strings for the whole text, which\nshows what sounds representations
  are needed to be created if every\nsound representation is unique;\n\nAll other
  variants of the beginning for the command line arguments\nare the same as \"0\"
  (the arguments are treated as a Ukrainian text\nand processed as a whole one object).
  \       \n\nThe resulting Strings and lists of Strings can be used further in the\nprograms:\n\n[mmsyn7ukr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr)\n\n[mmsyn7h](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7h)\n\nThe
  results of the previous ones can be processed also by the program: \n\n[mmsyn7l](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7l)\n"
