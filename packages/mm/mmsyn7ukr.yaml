description: "A program and a library that can be used as a simple \nbasic interface
  to some SoX functionality or for producing \nthe approximately Ukrainian speech
  with your own recorded \nvoice.\n\nThe program starts with Caution to be responsible
  for usage \nand to use it personally. Then the program guides you \nthrough the
  creating and using your Ukrainian \\\"voice\\\". \nPlease, use it carefully. After
  the execution the program if \nterminated naturally without interruption removes
  (cleans) \nall the created sound files in the current directory for \nsecurity reasons.
  If it terminates by interruption or in \ngeneral it is a good practice to remove
  the current \ndirectory sound files manually.\n\n        ***** CAUTION! *****\n\nWith
  great power comes great responsibility\n\nThe program mmsyn7ukr produces the approximately
  Ukrainian \nspeech with your own recorded voice. It approximates your \nvoice with
  a sequence of recorded separate sounds with \nyour control over the duration of
  the sounds. They are then \nprecessed by the SoX binaries in the system to produce
  the \nneeded sounds and then you can spell some Ukrainian text \nwith your recorded
  \"voice\". Be aware that if somebody can get \naccess to the sounds of your voice
  or to the recorded speech \nexcept you then this possibility creates security issues
  and \nconcerns. So, please, do NOT give access to the records to \nanybody else
  except you.\n\nThe program is for personal usage of every user ONLY!\n\nAs an advice,
  run the program in the empty writable, readable \nand seekable diractory only for
  the current user -- better \nin the RAM, wait until the program ends and then reboot
  the \ncomputer. If the program ends earlier, you must then remove \n(better wipe)
  the directory contents. No other users should \nhave access to the computer after
  you have begun to run the \nprogram and have not deleted (or better wiped) the contents
  \nof the directory. Please, be aware, that there are possibilities \nto read sensitive
  information from the drives after you have \ndeleted the files in a usual way. You
  can use wiping for better \nsecurity. Besides, if somebody can get access to the
  memory of \nthe computer or to the directory contents where you run the \nprogram
  or (may be) to the temporary files created by SoX or \nto the drive where you run
  the program (not in the RAM, or may \nbe in it) then your voice can be stolen and
  / or used \ninappropriately. Use all possible precautions and measures to \navoid
  the situation. \n\nBe aware also that the given by the program technology (or \ndocumentation
  for it in any form) of the voice processing can \nbe improved so there is NO guarantees
  that the given technology \nor its successors cannot be used in violating your voice
  identity \nto produce from some voice records available the voice for the \ninappropriate
  usage. So, better is to proove your identity not \nonly with the solely voice itself
  but with some additional \nindependent sources and measures. \n\nThe author of the
  program accordingly to the LICENSE (MIT) does not \nresponse for any possible issues,
  but by this notification tries to \nintent you to be aware of some possible issues.\n"
