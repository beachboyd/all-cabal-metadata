description: "A program and a library that can be used as a simple \nbasic interface
  to some SoX functionality or for producing \nthe approximately Ukrainian speech
  with your own recorded \nvoice.\n\nThe program starts with Caution to be responsible
  for usage \nand to use it personally. Then the program guides you \nthrough the
  creating and using your Ukrainian \\\"voice\\\". \nPlease, use it carefully. After
  the execution the program if \nterminated naturally without interruption removes
  (cleans) \nall the created sound files in the current directory for \nsecurity reasons.
  If it terminates by interruption or in \ngeneral it is a good practice to remove
  the current \ndirectory sound files manually.\n\n        ***** CAUTION! *****\n\n\"The
  possession of great power necessarily implies great responsibility.\"\n\n                                            (William
  Lamb)\n\nThe program mmsyn7ukr produces the close to proper Ukrainian \nspeech (if
  you correctly pronounce the sounds) with your own \nrecorded voice. It approximates
  your voice with a sequence \nof recorded separate sounds with your control over
  the \nduration of the sounds. They are then precessed by the SoX \nbinaries already
  installed in the system to produce the \nneeded sounds and then you can pronounce
  some Ukrainian text \nwith your recorded \"voice\". Nevertheless, you can substitute
  \nwhatever sounds you like (consider being sensible) instead of \nyour own voice.\n\nBe
  aware that if somebody can get access to the sounds of \nyour voice or to the recorded
  speech (except you) then this \npossibility itself creates security issues and concerns.
  So, \nplease, do NOT give access to such records to anybody else \nexcept you.\n\nIn
  such a case, the program is for personal usage of every \nuser ONLY!\n\nBeing given
  as an advice in such a case, run the program \nin the empty directory with the current
  user permissions to write, \nread and search and provide some proofs and evidence
  that nobody else \ncan even read the files in the directory. May be, it is better
  \nto execute the program being in the directory located in the RAM, \nthen consequently
  wait until the program ends and then reboot \nthe computer. \n\nIf the program ends
  earlier, you must then remove \n(better wipe) the directory contents. No other users
  should \nhave access to the computer after you have begun to run the \nprogram and
  have not deleted (or better wiped) the contents \nof the directory. Please, be aware,
  that there are possibilities \nto read sensitive information from the drives after
  you have \ndeleted the files in a usual way. You can use wiping for better \nsecurity.
  Besides, if somebody can get access to the memory of \nthe computer or to the directory
  contents where you run the \nprogram or (may be) to the temporary files created
  by SoX or \nto the drive where you run the program (not in the RAM, or may \nbe
  in it) then your voice can be stolen and / or used \ninappropriately. Use all possible
  precautions and measures to \navoid the situation. \n\nBe aware also that the given
  by the program technology (or \ndocumentation for it in any form) of the voice processing
  can \nbe improved so there is NO guarantees that the given technology \nor its successors
  cannot be used in violating your voice identity \nto produce from some available
  voice records the voice for the \ninappropriate usage. Therefore, better is to proove
  your identity not \nonly with the solely voice itself but with some additional \nindependent
  sources and measures. \n\nThe author of the program accordingly to the LICENSE (MIT)
  does not \nresponse for any possible issues, but by this notification tries to \nintent
  you to be aware of some possible issues.\n"
