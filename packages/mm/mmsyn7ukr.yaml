changelog: "# Revision history for mmsyn7ukr\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-12-19\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2019-12-19\n\n* First
  version revised A. Fixed an issue with an empty do-block (mismatched code indentation).\n\n##
  0.1.1.1 -- 2019-12-20\n\n* First version revised B. Improved some documentation
  and .cabal file.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2019-12-23\n\n* First version revised C. Fixed
  an issues with the not created and not appripriately running recording for the sound.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2019-12-24\n\n* Second version. Fixed an issue with the copying files.
  Changed a module structure. Some minor changes to the documentation.\n\n## 0.2.1.0
  -- 2019-12-24\n\n* Second version revised A. Extended the bounds for the base package
  dependency so that it now can be compiled for GHC 8.8.1. \nAdded some functionality
  to improve the control over the program mmsyn7ukr behaviour.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2019-12-24\n\n*
  Third version. Changed behaviour of the program so that it now only creates a \"voice\".
  It allows to use additional executable mmsyn7h afterwards from the package with
  the same name. \nThe latter is very close to mmsyn6ukr but uses the data files in
  the directory where it is running instead of defined by the standard for Paths_mmsyn6ukr.\n"

description: "A program and a library that can be used as a simple \nbasic interface
  to some SoX functionality or for producing \nthe approximately Ukrainian speech
  with your own recorded \nvoice.\n\nThe program starts with Caution to be responsible
  for usage \nand to use it personally. Then the program guides you \nthrough the
  creating and using your Ukrainian \"voice\". \nPlease, use it carefully. After the
  execution you can\nexecute mmsyn7h program to produce some records with your \nnewly
  created \"voice\". During the execution of the last one\nyou can choose whether
  to remove (clean) \nall the created sound files in the current directory for \nsecurity
  reasons. If the programs terminate by interruption or in \ngeneral it is a good
  practice to remove the current \ndirectory sound files manually.\n\n        *****
  CAUTION! *****\n\n\"The possession of great power necessarily implies great responsibility.\"\n\n
  \                                           (William Lamb)\n\nThe program mmsyn7ukr
  produces the close to proper Ukrainian \nspeech (if you correctly pronounce the
  sounds) with your own \nrecorded voice. It approximates your voice with a sequence
  \nof recorded separate sounds with your control over the \nduration of the sounds.
  They are then precessed by the SoX \nbinaries already installed in the system to
  produce the \nneeded sounds and then you can pronounce some Ukrainian text \nwith
  your recorded \"voice\" using mmsyn7h program. Nevertheless, \nyou can substitute
  whatever sounds you like (consider being \nsensible) instead of your own voice.\n\nBe
  aware that if somebody can get access to the sounds of \nyour voice or to the recorded
  speech (except you) then this \npossibility itself creates security issues and concerns.
  So, \nplease, do NOT give access to such records to anybody else \nexcept you.\n\nIn
  such a case, the program is for personal usage of every \nuser ONLY!\n\nBeing given
  as an advice in such a case, run the program \nin the empty directory with the current
  user permissions to write, \nread and search and provide some proofs and evidence
  that nobody else \ncan even read the files in the directory. May be, it is better
  \nto execute the program being in the directory located in the RAM, \nthen consequently
  wait until the program ends and then reboot \nthe computer. \n\nIf the program ends
  earlier, you must then remove \n(better wipe) the directory contents. No other users
  should \nhave access to the computer after you have begun to run the \nprogram and
  have not deleted (or better wiped) the contents \nof the directory. Please, be aware,
  that there are possibilities \nto read sensitive information from the drives after
  you have \ndeleted the files in a usual way. You can use wiping for better \nsecurity.
  Besides, if somebody can get access to the memory of \nthe computer or to the directory
  contents where you run the \nprogram or (may be) to the temporary files created
  by SoX or \nto the drive where you run the program (not in the RAM, or may \nbe
  in it) then your voice can be stolen and / or used \ninappropriately. Use all possible
  precautions and measures to \navoid the situation. \n\nBe aware also that the given
  by the program technology (or \ndocumentation for it in any form) of the voice processing
  can \nbe improved so there is NO guarantees that the given technology \nor its successors
  cannot be used in violating your voice identity \nto produce from some available
  voice records the voice for the \ninappropriate usage. Therefore, better is to proove
  your identity not \nonly with the solely voice itself but with some additional \nindependent
  sources and measures. \n\nThe author of the program accordingly to the LICENSE (MIT)
  does not \nresponse for any possible issues, but by this notification tries to \nintent
  you to be aware of some possible issues.\n"
