description: "For the proper proceeding you specify a String, which consists of 4
  \ndigits (and it may be preceeded by a symbol \"-\"). If the String \nbegins with
  the \"-\", then a sound amplitude decreases, otherwise \nthe amplitude increases.
  The level of increase / decrease is \ndetermined by the magnitude of the absolute
  value of integer numbers. \nThe greater is the number -- the greater is the amplitude
  change. \nThe count begins with \"0000\" and ends with \"9999\" (the sign is not
  \ntaken into consideration). In such a case, for the Strings without the \ninitial
  sign \"-\" (the sound increases) an interval between the \nmaximum by modulus value
  of the amlitude (which is represented by the \nparts of 1) and 1.0 is divided into
  10 equal parts (starting a count \nfrom 0) and then that one of them is selected,
  which has a number \ndetermined by the first digit in the String writing. Then (if
  specified \nfurther) the interval between this amplitude value and a value, \nwhich
  corresponds to the selection on the previous step the next \nfirst digit in the
  writing (for example, after \"4\" -- \"5\", \nafter \"7\" --\"8\" etc.), greater
  by 1 than the actually selected one, \nis also divided again into 10 equal parts
  and that one is selected, \nwhich corresponds to the number determined by the second
  digit in the \nString writing (again beginning with \"0\" and ending with \"9\")
  and so on \nuntil the 4th level. The greater exactness is not needed because our
  \nhearing ability hardly distinguish such a subtle sound changes. If \nthe String
  has as a first element the \"-\" Char (the sound decreases), \nthen everything is
  analogously the same, but an interval between the \nmaximum by modulus amplitude
  value and 0.0 is divided into 10 equal parts \nand so on.\n"
