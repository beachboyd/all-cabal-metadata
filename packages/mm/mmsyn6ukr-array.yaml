                ***** Usage *****
                =================

  The program can be used as a special musical instrument
  or a voicing for Ukrainian text. It is not
  phonetically exact and proper, but it gives
  an inspiration to listen to the Ukrainian sounds more attentively.
  It can be used by writers (especially poets) to compose melodic
  texts. It can be used simply for the experiments. There is an
  opinion that Ukrainian is a very melodic language, so you can
  even not knowing it get some impression and get acquainted with
  this beautiful language. There are a lot of songs in it and the
  program is intended to open some part of beauty of the language itself.

  The phonetic and writing system material are from the source:

  the Ukrainian writing system. Electronic resource](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0802/0802.4198.pdf)

  Uses the ukrainian-phonetics-basic-array package.
