  \n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2020-05-12\n\n* Seventh version. Changed the module structure
  (and some functions accordinly, too) to more logical and convenient for factorization
  and composition. \nAdded a new module Melodics.Executable with the most of the Main
  module processment functions. Changed the behaviour of the executable \ninto repeated
  so you can create many files with it during one runtime operation. \n\n## 0.7.1.0
  -- 2020-05-12\n\n* Seventh version revised A. Fixed issues with being not circled
  because of the semi-closed handles. \n\n## 0.7.2.0 -- 2020-05-14\n\n* Seventh version
  revised B. Fixed bounds of the dependencies so that now it is supported also for
  GHC 8.10* series.\n\n## 0.7.3.0 -- 2020-06-01\n\n* Seventh version revised C. Added
  Melodics.Executable.recFileName function to the export list of the module because
  it is re-used by the dobutokO-poetry \npackage.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2020-08-16\n\n*
  Eighth version. Added a new module MMSyn6Ukr.Show7s with the function from mmsyn7s
  module. It is done for the possible refactoring and changing the dependencies \nfor
  other packages (first of all, mmsyn7h).\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2020-09-25\n\n* Eighth
  version revised A. Added to the exported functions isUkrainian from the Melodics.Ukrainian

description: "              ***** Usage *****\n              =================\n\nThe
  program can be used as a special musical instrument \nor a voicing for Ukrainian
  text. It is not \nphonetically exact and proper, but it gives \nan inspiration to
  listen to the Ukrainian sounds more attentively.\nIt can be used by writers (especially
  poets) to compose melodic\ntexts. It can be used simply for the experiments. There
  is an\nopinion that Ukrainian is a very melodic language, so you can\neven not knowing
  it get some impression and get acquainted with\nthis beautiful language. There are
  a lot of songs in it and the \nprogram is intended to open some part of beauty of
  the language itself.\n\nThe phonetic and writing system material are from the source:\n\n[Solomija
  Buk, Ján Mačutek, Andrij Rovenchak. Some properties of \nthe Ukrainian writing system.
