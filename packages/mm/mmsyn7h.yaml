changelog: "# Revision history for mmsyn7h\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-12-24\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2019-12-25\n\n* Second
  version. Changed the behaviour of the program.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2019-12-25\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Program now is a library and a executable, it has another
  module structure. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.2.2.0 -- 2019-12-28\n\n*
  Second version revised B. Fixed an issue with the null command line arguments and
  with playing of the created file.\n\n## 0.2.2.1 -- 2019-12-28\n\n* Second version
  revised C. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-01-05\n\n*
  Third version. Added support for Windows playing the resulting file. Fixed an issue
  with the deprecated documentation.\n\n## 0.3.0.1 -- 2020-01-05\n\n* Third version
  revised A. Fixed an issue with the not compiling code.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-01-10\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added the possibility to work with not the full set of Ukrainian
  sounds representations, but with some of them. \nThe program now can use more command
  line arguments. Added new functions and dependencies.\n\n## 0.4.0.1 -- 2020-01-10\n\n*
  Fourth version revised A. Fixed an issue with the more than three command line arguments.
  The program now plays the file in such a\ncase and does not remove any resulting
  sound files.\n\n## 0.4.0.2 -- 2020-01-10\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Fixed an
  issue with documentation for the appendS16LEFileList function.\n\n## 0.4.0.3 --
  2020-01-10\n\n* Fourth version revised C. Fixed an issue with documentation for
  the appendS16LEFileList function.\n\n## 0.4.1.0 -- 2020-01-10\n\n* Fourth version
  revised D. Fixed issues with package not being compiled. \nImproved informational
  messages. \n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2020-01-14\n\n* Fifth version. Added more command line
  options like \"-h\" and \"-v\". New module \ndependencies. Fixed issues with the
  deprecated wrong documentation.\n\n## 0.5.1.0 -- 2020-01-16\n\n* Fifth version revised
  A. Fixed issue with threads. Now, mmsyn7h must run without blocking the other Haskell
  threads.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2020-01-24\n\n* Sixth version. Changed the behaviour for
  the giving information. Now the package uses 'catchEnd' function from the mmsyn7ukr
  package.\nBesides, the last one now is a dependency for the package.\n\n## 0.6.0.1
  -- 2020-01-24\n\n* Sixth version revised A. Fixed version information. Changed the
  information being displayed in case of obtaining informational messages.\n\n## 0.6.1.0
  -- 2020-01-24\n\n* Sixth version revised B. Fixed an issue with being not compiled
  dependency mmsyn7ukr for GHC 7.8.4.\n\n## 0.6.2.0 -- 2020-01-28\n\n* Sixth version
  revised C. Changed the imported modules and dependency bounds.\n\n## 0.7.0.0 --
  2020-01-28\n\n* Seventh version. Changed the behaviour of the mmsyn7h function.
  Fixed issues with program being executed further after the giving the needed information.\nSome
  minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.7.0.1 -- 2020-01-28\n\n* Seventh version
  revised A. Fixed issues with unexact documentation (e. g. README file). \n"

description: "The executable mmsyn7h is auxiliary for the mmsyn7ukr package\n(https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr).
  \nIt works similarly to the mmsyn6ukr executable, but uses the voice \nsound files
  in the current directory. This allows to change the \nneeded files and to produce
  them by some other means (e. g. by \nmmsyn7ukr).\nBesides, you can remove the created
  by mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7h files\nwhile the last one is running.\n\nThe program mmsyn7h
  plays the newly created file once. Then it can delete \nthe sound files in the current
  directory while being executed if the\nentered text starts with \"0\". If you enter
  as a first command line\nargument \"-h\", then the program prints informational
  message and\nis terminated successfully (but with exception). If you specify as
  a\nfirst command line argument \"-v\", then the program prints its\nversion number
  and is also successfully terminated (with exception).\nIf you specify something
  else, the first command line argument\nis being treated as a name for the resulting
  file voiced.\nIf you specify further command line arguments as a Ukrainian text,\nthat
  contains only those sounds, which sound representations are\nin the current directory
  (you can create them by e. g. mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7l\nprograms in the same name packages),
  then the program will use only\nthese sounds representations additionally to the
  default ones\n\"-.wav\", \"0.wav\" and \"1.wav\" and produce the sounding for the
  text.\nFor more information, refer to:\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7s\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7l\nIn
  such a case the program will not delete the created resulting \nsound files.\n\nIf
  you do not specify the Ukrainian text as the third and the next command line\narguments,
  then the resulting file will be played just after it is created\nby the program.
  To remove all the created sound files from the directory,\nplease, specify now the
  first character in the input as \"0\". Otherwise,\nthe program will not remove any
  records (if they are not overwritten). \n"
