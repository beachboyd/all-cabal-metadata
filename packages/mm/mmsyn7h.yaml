  version. Changed the behaviour of the program.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2019-12-25\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Program now is a library and a executable, it has another
  module structure. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.2.2.0 -- 2019-12-28\n\n*
  Second version revised B. Fixed an issue with the null command line arguments and
  with playing of the created file.\n\n## 0.2.2.1 -- 2019-12-28\n\n* Second version
  revised C. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-01-05\n\n*

description: "The executable mmsyn7h is auxilary for the mmsyn7ukr package\n(https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr).
  \nIt works similarly to the mmsyn6ukr executable, but uses the voice \nsound files
  in the current directory. This allows to change the \nneeded files and to produce
  them by some other means (e. g. by \nmmsyn7ukr).\nBesides, you can remove the created
  by mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7h files\nwhile the last one is running, if you specified
  just one command line \nargument. \n\nIf you specify the second command line argument
  \"s\" and then \nString of the Ukrainian text, then \nthe program will use only
  these sounds representations \nadditionally to the default ones \"-.wav\", \"0.wav\"
  and \"1.wav\".\nTo create the needed sound representations, please, execute\nmmsyn7s
  with the needed Ukrainian text to be sounded (being a\ncommand line arguments) and
  then use the resulting output as a third\ncommand line argument to the mmsyn7ukr
  program.\nFor more information, refer to:\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7s\n\nIn
  such a case the program will not delete the created resulting \nsound files.\n"
