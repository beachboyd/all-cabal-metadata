  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2019-12-25\n\n* Second
  version. Changed the behaviour of the program.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2019-12-25\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Program now is a library and a executable, it has another
  module structure. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.2.2.0 -- 2019-12-28\n\n*
  Second version revised B. Fixed an issue with the null command line arguments and
  with playing of the created file.\n\n## 0.2.2.1 -- 2019-12-28\n\n* Second version
  revised C. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-01-05\n\n*
  Third version. Added support for Windows playing the resulting file. Fixed an issue
  with the deprecated documentation.\n\n## 0.3.0.1 -- 2020-01-05\n\n* Third version
  revised A. Fixed an issue with the not compiling code.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-01-10\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added the possibility to work with not the full set of Ukrainian
  sounds representations, but with some of them. \nThe program now can use more command
  line arguments. Added new functions and dependencies.\n\n## 0.4.0.1 -- 2020-01-10\n\n*
  Fourth version revised A. Fixed an issue with the more than three command line arguments.
  The program now plays the file in such a\ncase and does not remove any resulting
  sound files.\n\n## 0.4.0.2 -- 2020-01-10\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Fixed an
  issue with documentation for the appendS16LEFileList function.\n\n## 0.4.0.3 --
  2020-01-10\n\n* Fourth version revised C. Fixed an issue with documentation for
  the appendS16LEFileList function.\n\n## 0.4.1.0 -- 2020-01-10\n\n* Fourth version
  revised D. Fixed issues with package not being compiled. \nImproved informational
  messages. \n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2020-01-14\n\n* Fifth version. Added more command line
  options like \"-h\" and \"-v\". New module \ndependencies. Fixed issues with the
  deprecated wrong documentation.\n\n## 0.5.1.0 -- 2020-01-16\n\n* Fifth version revised
  A. Fixed issue with threads. Now, mmsyn7h must run without blocking the other Haskell

  the giving information. Now the package uses 'catchEnd' function from the mmsyn7ukr
  package.\nBesides, the last one now is a dependency for the package.\n\n## 0.6.0.1
  -- 2020-01-24\n\n* Sixth version revised A. Fixed version information. Changed the
  information being displayed in case of obtaining informational messages.\n\n## 0.6.1.0

  dependency mmsyn7ukr for GHC 7.8.4.\n\n## 0.6.2.0 -- 2020-01-28\n\n* Sixth version
  revised C. Changed the imported modules and dependency bounds.\n\n## 0.7.0.0 --
  2020-01-28\n\n* Seventh version. Changed the behaviour of the mmsyn7h function.

  given information for \"-h\" or \"-v\" command line arguments.\nSome documentation
  imrovements.\n\n## 0.7.1.0 -- 2020-01-28\n\n* Seventh version revised C. Changed
  dependencies for modules. Changed errors to exceptions.\n\n## 0.7.1.1 -- 2020-01-28\n\n*
  Seventh version revised D. Fixed issue with the wrong version number.\n\n## 0.7.2.0
  -- 2020-01-30\n\n* Seventh version revised E. Changed the README file to the README.markdown.
  \n\n## 0.7.3.0 -- 2020-03-11\n\n* Seventh version revised G. Fixed issue with being
  removed all sound files with extensions in the current directory in case of being
  executed without\nthird and more command line arguments (no matter whether you specify
  to remove them or not). Changed the 'main7h' function and its realization.\nThe
  possibility to clean sound files is now controlled by the separate prompt after
  inputing the text to be sounded. For this,\na new function 'defineClean' is used.\n\n##
  0.7.3.1 -- 2020-03-11\n\n* Seventh version revised H. Fixed issue with deprecated
  information in the README.markdown file.\n\n## 0.7.4.0 -- 2020-03-11\n\n* Seventh
  version revised I. Fixed issue with being not compiled because of the syntactic
  mistake.\n\n## 0.7.5.0 -- 2020-03-11\n\n* Seventh version revised J. Fixed issue
  with being not compiled because of the syntactic mistake in the do-block. Simplified
  the 'main7h' function code being written. \n\n## 0.7.6.0 -- 2020-05-14\n\n* Seventh
  version revised K. Changed bounds for dependencies so that now also GHC 8.10* series
  are supported.\n\n## 0.7.7.0 -- 2020-06-24\n\n* Seventh version revised J. Changed
  bounds for dependencies so that now it is consistent with new dobutokO packages.
  Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2020-08-16\n\n* Eighth version.
  Removed mmsyn7s from the dependencies, instead use a mmsyn6ukr version more than
  0.8.0.0.\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2020-12-03\n\n* Eighth version revised A. Fixed issues
  with being not compiled for some versions. Changed the dependency \nboundaries.\n"

description: "         ***** General Information *****\n         ===============================\n\nThe
  executable mmsyn7h is auxiliary for the\n[mmsyn7ukr package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr).
  \nIt works similarly to the\n[mmsyn6ukr executable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn6ukr),\nbut
  uses the voice sound files in the current directory. This allows to change the \nneeded
  files and to produce them by some other means (e. g. by \nmmsyn7ukr).\nBesides,
  you can remove the created by mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7h files\nwhile the last one is
  running.\n\n         ***** Processing *****\n         ======================\n\nThe
  program mmsyn7h plays the newly created file once. Then it can delete \nthe sound
  files in the current directory while being executed. To define\nwhether to clean
  the sound files after executing, user is prompted after\nspcifying the input text.\n\nIf
  you enter as a first command line argument \"-h\", then the program only\nprints
  informational message. If you specify as a first command line\nargument \"-v\",
  then the program only prints its version number.\n\nIf you specify something else,
  the first command line argument\nis being treated as a name for the resulting file
  voiced. The second\ncommand line argument (if any) must be the controlling parameter\n(for
  more information, refer to:\n[mmsyn6ukr:genControl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn6ukr-0.8.0.0/docs/UkrainianLControl.html#v:genControl).
  \nIf you specify further command line arguments as a Ukrainian text,\nthat contains
  only those sounds, which sound representations are\nin the current directory (you
  can create them by e. g. mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7l\nprograms in the same name packages),
  then the program will use only\nthese sounds representations additionally to the
  default ones\n\"-.wav\", \"0.wav\" and \"1.wav\" and produce the sounding for the
  text.\nFor more information, refer to:\n[mmsyn7ukr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr)\n[mmsyn7s](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7s)\n[mmsyn7l](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7l)\nIn
  such a case the program will not delete the created resulting \nsound files.\n\nIf
  you do not specify the Ukrainian text as the third and the next command line\narguments,
  then the resulting file will be played just after it is created\nby the program.
  To remove all the created sound files from the directory,\nplease, specify the first
  character in the line when being promted to define\nwhether to remove sound files
  as \"y\". Otherwise, the program will not remove\nany sound files while being executed.\n"
