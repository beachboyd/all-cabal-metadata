description: "The executable mmsyn7h is auxilary for the mmsyn7ukr package\n(https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr).
  \nIt works similarly to the mmsyn6ukr executable, but uses the voice \nsound files
  in the current directory. This allows to change the \nneeded files and to produce
  them by some other means (e. g. by \nmmsyn7ukr).\nBesides, you can remove the created
  by mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7h files\nwhile the last one is running. \nIf you specify
  the second command line argument \"s\" and then \na list of @String@ represented
  the Ukrainian sounds, then \nthe program will use only these sounds representations
  \nadditionally to the default ones \"-.wav\", \"0.wav\" and \"1.wav\".\n"
