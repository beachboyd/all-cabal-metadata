  Git conflict resolution has never been easier

  When encountering a conflict, you can sometimes
  imagine: if only I could have applied one of
  these patches BEFORE the other rather than
  concurrently, I wouldn't be in this mess!

  Well, with git-mediate, you can!

  In any conflicted state - git-mediate shows you
  the 2 diffs involved. By applying these diffs to
  the base version and the other version, you
  emulate the situation where the patch had already
  existed when the other had been applied.

  Reapply git-mediate, it will validate that you've
  indeed applied it correctly, and bam: conflict
  disappeared!

  Git-mediate also lets you handle modify/delete
  conflicts (there's no sane way in git to show
  what the modification actually was)

  Git-mediate also streamlines jumping to the
  conflicts with your editor, either with the `-e`
  option to invoke your editor, or via the standard
  line number format, which is parsed by all major
  editors, to allow use of "jump to next error"
  keys.

  Git-mediate especially shines with automatic
  source transformation tools such as renamers.

  In a conflicted state, re-apply a rename that
  caused the conflict, run git-mediate without
  opening any files, and the conflicts are gone!
