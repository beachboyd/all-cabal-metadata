  Some handy Template Haskell splices for including the current git hash

  and branch in the code of your project. Useful for including in panic

  messages, `--version` output, or diagnostic info for more informative

  bug reports.


  Most of the complication in the `GitHash` module is due to the various

  places the current git hash might be stored:


  1. Detached HEAD: the hash is in `.git/HEAD`

  2. On a branch or tag: the hash is in a file pointed to by `.git/HEAD`

  in a location like `.git/refs/heads`

  3. On a branch or tag but in a repository with packed refs: the hash is

  in `.git/packed-refs`


  These situations all arise under normal development workflows, but

  there might be further scenarios that cause problems. Let me know if

  you run into them!
