description: ! 'This library attempts to provide a memory efficient alternative to

  Data.Map. The BerkeleyDB system is bound and exposed through an

  interface that mimics Data.Map as much as possible.


  Features include: pure interface with fairly efficient sharing

  and a very small memory footprint.


  Tested with libdb4.6'
