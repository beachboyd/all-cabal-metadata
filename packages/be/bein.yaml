description: ! "Bein\n----\n\nBein is a provenance and workflow system for bioinformatics.
  \ Typically a bioinformaticist ends up with a dozen scripts and a thousand or so
  files from running the scripts with slightly varying parameters and no way to keep
  track of what came from where.  Bein resolves this by keeping scripts, and their
  executions on inputs and the resulting outputs, in a database, and providing a web
  interface to the system.\n\nOrganization of the build directory\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe
  build directory contains the following items:\n\nbein.cabal    -- The equivalent
  of a Makefile for Haskell\ndoc/          -- Documentation for the system\npriv/files/
  \  -- A default directory for data files stored in Bein\npriv/scratch/ -- A default
  working directory for scripts run by Bein\nSetup.lhs     -- Part of the infrastructure
  needed by bein.cabal.  DO NOT EDIT.\nsql/          -- All code for setting up the
  PostgreSQL database\nsrc/\t      -- Haskell source code\ntemplates/    -- Template
  files for the web interface\n\n"
