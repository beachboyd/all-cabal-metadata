  Change to the new Control.Exception from base version 4.\n0.5 13 Dec 2008\n    -
  Change all 'unsafe' to 'safe' so it'll work better in a threaded\n    environment.\n

description: ! "Berkeley DB / Berkeley DB XML binding for Haskell\n6 May 2011\nby
  Stephen Blackheath\n\nemail me: http://blacksapphire.com/antispam/\ndarcs repository:
  http://blacksapphire.com/BerkeleyDBXML/\nintroduction/tutorial: http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/BerkeleyDBXML\n\n\nBerkeley
  DB XML is a powerful, fully transactional, XML-based database that uses\nXQuery
  as its query language.  It is NOT an SQL database.  It is not free for\ncommercial
  use.  You can download it here:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/xml/index.html\n\nThis
  package provides a Haskell binding for Berkeley DB XML.  It is a tolerable\nsubset
  of the API, and I hope to improve it over time.  I have stuck closely to\nthe C++
  API, with some minor changes where a Haskell idiom seemed appropriate.\nI hope that
  people will develop higher level wrappers for it.  I have had great\nsuccess with
  the \"pickler\" interfaces in the HXT library.  See the adventure\nexample in the
  examples/ directory.\n\nThe binding is only about 70% complete, but it should allow
  you to write a fairly\nserious application.  If you would like a particular part
  of the API added,\nplease contact me.\n\nTo install, use the standard Cabal install
  procedure:\n\nIf Berkeley DB or DB XML is not installed in the default location
  of /usr or\n/usr/local, you will need to specify the paths in this way:\n\ncabal
  install BerkeleyDBXML \\\n    --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/include/
  \\\n    --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/include/dbxml/ \\\n    --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/lib/\n\nSee
  the examples/ directory for examples.\n\n"
